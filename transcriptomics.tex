\chapter{Consistency through different transcriptomics studies}
\label{sec:Transcriptomics}

As previously stated in the introduction, while I started this project,
there wasn't any study that was investigating in-depth the reproducibility of
transcriptomics.

Should the following go to the intro?
\end{comment}

However, in August 2014 a paper comparing different preparation methods,
sequencing technologies operated in different laboratories
on samples from the same biological source concludes that while absolute
measurements are not consistent, the relative expression is highly consistent
(95\% pearson correlation?)
