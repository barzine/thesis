\chapter{Expression in normal human tissues across RNA-Seq studies}
\label{ch:Transcriptomics}

In the perspective of paving the way towards
a generalised baseline expression reference for the normal human,
in this chapter, I assess the similarity
of the tissues sourced from different \Rnaseq\ studies and
the general profiles of their expressed genes.

All the work presented in this chapter was performed by myself under the
supervision of \alvis.
I received invaluable advise and help from my discussions with \nuno.
I also received general feedback and comments from \mar, \johan, \sarah, \gos\
and \wolfgang.

When I started this project in 2013,
little was then known on either the robustness or
the shortcomings and pitfalls of \Rnaseq\ and
its related processing.
Since then, several studies were published assessing \Rnaseq.
A few present a closely related scope to my own investigations, thus
whenever relevant,
I introduce and discuss my results in relation to the published ones.

\section{Working sets}

While other approaches may be used,
I usually consider the most conservative routes.
Thus, I first reduced my working sets to the tissues and genes that were
commonly explored and measured in each study.

Through this chapter, I use two working sets:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,nosep]
    \item \setOne: 4 tissues --- 12,268 genes across the 5 \Rnaseq\ studies, and
    \item \setTwo: 23 tissues --- 17,551 genes across 2 of these studies.
\end{itemize}

The following \cref{subsec:tran_tissueOverlap,subsec:trans_GeneOverlap}
illustrate the construction of these sets.

\subsection{Tissue overlaps across the available normal human RNA-Seq studies}
\label{subsec:tran_tissueOverlap}

\Cref{fig:VennStudiesT} presents the five datasets overlapping tissues.
Notice that they all share at least four tissues:
\heart, \kidney, \liver\ and \testis.
This 4-tissue set is the base of one working set.

\begin{figure}[h]%[!htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{transcriptomics/TransVennTissue.pdf}\centering
\caption[Distribution of unique and shared tissues between the
transcriptomic datasets]
{\label{fig:VennStudiesT}\textbf{Distribution of unique and shared tissues
between the transcriptomic datasets.} The 5 datasets share 4
common tissues: \heart, \kidney, \liver\ and \testis.
The biggest overlap of tissues (23) is between \uhlen\ and \gtex.
These two sets of tissues are the main focus of the transcriptomic part of the
study.}
\end{figure}

Also, observe that the greatest number of shared tissues is
between the two most recent studies:
\uhlen\ and \gtex.
They constitutes the base of a second 23-tissue working set that includes
\Adipose, \Adrenal, \Bladder, \Cortex, \hcolon, \Esophagus,
\Fallopian, \heart, \kidney, \liver, \lung, \Ovary, \Pancreas, \Prostate,
\salivary, \skeletal, \skin, \intestine, \spleen, \stomach, \testis,
\thyroid\ and \uterus.

\subsection{Common measured genes for each of the common tissues sets}
\label{subsec:trans_GeneOverlap}
As shown in \Cref{tab:Trans5DF},
many of the transcriptomic datasets I use have been produced through
polyA-selected library protocols.
Hence, most of the analyses are limiting to genes with a biotype annotated as
\emph{\pc}
to avoid unnecessary biases\footnote{See
\Cref{subsec:protcodingOnly}: \nameref{subsec:protcodingOnly}.}.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{transcriptomics/PcodingGenesExpressed1_4tissues.pdf}\centering
    \caption[Unique and shared \pcgs\ expressed
    in the 4 common tissues (≥1 \FPKM)]{\label{fig:ExpGenePcoding1}\textbf{Unique
    and shared \pcgs\ expressed ≥ 1 \FPKM\ in the 4 common tissues
    across the 5 studies.}}
\end{figure}

The Venn diagram presented in \Cref{fig:ExpGenePcoding1} only includes protein
genes that are observed\footnote{See
\Cref{sec:ExpressedOrNot}: \nameref{sec:ExpressedOrNot}.}
at least once at 1 \FPKM\ for one of the four shared tissues.
Plainly, the bulk of genes expressed at this threshold is common
across the five datasets.
Indeed, while each study presents a tiny portion of genes
that are unique,
overall most genes are detected in two or more studies.
The greatest contingent of shared genes is between \uhlen\ and \gtex.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{transcriptomics/vennTissue23_1protcodgenes.pdf}\centering
    \caption[Unique and shared \pcgs\ expressed

    {\label{fig:ExpGenePcoding1_t23}\textbf{Unique
    and shared \pcgs\ expressed ≥ 1 FPKM in the 23 common tissues
    of \uhlen\ and \gtex\ studies.}}
\end{figure}

In this respect, \Cref{fig:ExpGenePcoding1_t23} presents a similar Venn diagram
while focusing on the twenty-three common tissue set between \uhlen\ and \gtex.
The number of unique genes to each study is negligible compared to the bulk:
it represents less than 0.03\% of the measured genes in each of the studies.
\begin{comment}
    Gtex:   462/17551 hence 0.02632329\%
    Uhlen:  281/17551 hence 0.01601048\%
\end{comment}

\NB\ None of the subgroups of uncommonly shared genes presents any functional
annotation enrichment.

\section{Prevalence of biological signal over technical variabilities at
tissue level}
\label{sec:Trans_ReproExpresTissue}

As I show in \Cref{ch:expression}, within the same study,
the expression levels of same-tissue samples are highly correlated and
allow to group the samples based on their biological source.
In fact, clustering the samples across the studies offers a quick assessment of
the underlying causes of the expression levels measurements.
A clustering by study means that the technical variabilities are stronger
than any biological expression signature.
On the other hand,
an interstudy sample clustering by tissue implies that \Rnaseq\ measurements
are less prone to batch effects and more robust than measurements by
microarray assays~\mycite{Taminau2014-hr,Walsh2015-nf}.

\Cref{fig:noMitoNoRep4T} and \Cref{fig:noMitoNoRep23T}
are the respective heatmaps of the hierarchical clustering
of the \emph{virtual references}\footnote{See \Cref{subsec:averagedTissue}:
\nameref{subsec:averagedTissue}.}
for the four common tissues across the five datasets and the
twenty-three common tissues between \uhlen\ and \gtex\ studies.
The heatmaps are based on the clustering of these references based on
their Pearson correlation coefficients with the Ward's method
of the \pcgs\ (≥ 1 \FPKM, and excluding
the mitochondrial genes).

The clustering plainly highlights a greater similarity of the references
due to their biological origins over any possible
similarity due to technical variations of library preparation or processing.
Indeed, each cluster concordes to a tissue in \Cref{fig:noMitoNoRep4T}.
While we may object that
the very different gene expression (and levels) in
\Heart, \Kidney, \Liver\ and \Testis,
may drive this result,
\Cref{fig:noMitoNoRep23T} confirms that the biological origin of the tissues
is the dominant criterion for the clustering of the references.
Even if we observe a few mixture of references,
the majority of them cluster by tissue.
Moreover, in many cases, the mixture are from close biologically related tissues,
\eg\ \fallopian\ and \Ovary, \salivary\
with \Esophagus\ or \Stomach\ references.
\Cref{fig:noMitoRep4T} and \Cref{fig:noMitoRep23T}
present heatmaps for the same tissues and studies,
but where every available sample is included\footnote{I.e\
there may be several samples for a same tissue in each study.}.
These two supplementary figures also support that
the biological signal is in overall stronger than the technical variations.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{transcriptomics/heatmap4TnoMitonoRep_1.pdf}\centering
    \caption[Heatmap of the 4 common tissues across the 5 studies]%
    {\label{fig:noMitoNoRep4T}\textbf{Heatmap of the 4 common tissues
    across the 5 studies.}\\All \pcgs\ (except the mitochondrial
    ones) at least expressed at 1 \FPKM\ are included.\\We observe that all the
    different references cluster by tissue (instead, for example, of studies)
    of origin.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{transcriptomics/heatmap23TnoMitonoRep_1.pdf}\centering
    \caption[Heatmap of 23 common tissues between Uhlén and GTEx studies]%
    {\label{fig:noMitoNoRep23T}%
    \textbf{Heatmap of 23 common tissues between Uhlén and GTEx studies.}\\
    All \pcgs\ (≥ 1 FPKM with the exclusion of the mitochondrial
    genes) are included.\\Most samples cluster by tissues but a few exception.
    Indeed, we observe a mixture of the \tissue{Fallopian tube}
    and \tissue{Ovary} samples.
    In addition, \tissue{Salivary gland} samples may be more correlated to
    \tissue{Esophagus} or \tissue{Stomach} regarding the original study.
    Only the \tissue{Bladder} samples seem to cluster randomly with the other
    samples. However, these samples are in singleton group as a leaf.}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:SamedistribPearsCorr} shows the distribution of the Pearson correlation
coefficients for the pairs of same tissue references
sourced from the different studies
for both of the working datasets.

Most of the Pearson correlations are above 0.5\footnote{Indeed, apart of the
correlation between the \Testis\ references of \castle\ and \vt\ (0.42)
for the 4-tissues working set and
\Salivary\ references of \uhlen\ and \gtex\ (0.2)
for the 23-tissues working set.}
even with the lack of any batch effect correction.
The median correlation for the four common tissues across the five datasets is
about 0.7 and 0.84 for the twenty-three tissues between \uhlen\ and \gtex\ studies.
Results are even better with Spearman Correlation:
the averages are respectively 0.49 for the 4-tissues sets
and 0.9 for the 23-tissues set and
the median correlations are 0.88 and 0.93.

Thus, both the Pearson\footnote{despite one major outlier in the second
working set (\tissue{Salivary gland} --- Pearson correlation: 0.2)} and the
Spearman correlation coefficients for the more exhaustive 23-tissues working set
comprising the two most recent studies,
are greater than the observed correlation for the 4-tissues working set.
Three main reasons may explain this situation:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,nosep]
    \item Besides of using paired-end sequencing,
        the library preparation protocols were better established
        for these two studies;
    \item The instrument used for the sequencing were
        from the same series (HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500); and
    \item These studies present a higher number of replicates per tissue.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.70]%
{transcriptomics/TransPearsonDistributionIdenticalOnly.pdf}\centering
\caption[Distribution of the correlation of same tissue pairs for the 4 and 23
tissues working sets.]{\label{fig:SamedistribPearsCorr}\textbf{Distribution
of the Pearson correlation of same tissues pairs for the 4 and the 23 tissues
working sets.} In general, the Pearson correlation are high even though we are
\emph{directly} comparing samples from different studies.\\
The 23-tissues working set (\setTwo) presents a higher median correlation ($0.85$)
and narrower distribution for the pairs bulk than
the 4-tissues working set (\setOne) (median$ = 0.74$).
However, \setTwo\ displays one outlier with
a very low Pearson correlation ($0.2$: \salivary\ tissue.).
This outlier may be just as well explained by sampling, biological or processing
issues.}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:distribCorr} presents the different pairs of tissues across the
datasets in addition to the same tissue pairs.
The pairs comprising different tissues are very lowly correlated in general.

\NB\ In few cases, for the 23-tissues working set,
high correlations are also observed (see also \Cref{fig:noMitoNoRep23T}).
It is rather hard to decipher if this may not be due to an issue at the collection
or library preparation stage or because these tissues are biologically very close.

\section{Possible driving force of the closer intratissue rather intrastudy
similarity}

Since \Rnaseq\ allows distinguishing a common biological source
of most samples across different studies,
the question then arises as to what is driving these interstudy
strong correlations.

As discussed in \Cref{ch:expression} (see \Cref{sec:ExpressedOrNot}:
\nameref{sec:ExpressedOrNot}),
correlation coefficients measure the dependence between (here) two tissue references
and are subject to outliers and the skewness of the distributions.
Thus, the next intuitive step is to test
whether a particular subset of the genes may drive the correlation coefficients,
\ie\ --- as I have excluded the
\emph{undefined}\footnote{\ie\ \emph{unobserved} --- See also
\Cref{subsec:ExpressedOrNot-undefined}: \nameref{subsec:ExpressedOrNot-undefined}}
genes from the analyses ---
are the highest, the most variable or another group of genes
the underlying reasons of the strong correlations.

\subsection{Highest expressed genes}

The notion of highest expressed genes may be trivial,
but it is worth remembering that the normalisation methods are impacting
the final expression values.
Note that individual genes may have, or not,
the highest expression values for a given condition
depending on the normalisation methods
(see \Cref{subsub:norm}:~\nameref{subsub:norm})
Although, in the present case,
by processing the data with consistent methods and annotation
and by excluding selected sets of
genes\footnote{See \Cref{sec:bias_sources}:~\nameref{sec:bias_sources}}
I avoid many biases.

\NB\ If I had picked another normalisation method than \FPKM\footnote{See
\Cref{eq:rpkm-fx}},
the exclusion filter would impact a different set of genes.

To test the influence of highest expressed genes on correlation coefficients,
I chose to visualise the evolution of the correlation
in function of expression value thresholds.
Indeed, for \Cref{fig:CorHighExp4T} and \Cref{fig:CorHighExp23T},
I computed the correlation of genes expressed above a cut-off
for each pair of identical tissues within each of the two working datasets.
The cut-off is a range of possible (integer number) value of gene expression
(using 10 as a step).

In \Cref{fig:CorHighExp4T}, that shows the 4-tissues working set,
except for very few pairs, the highest correlations correspond to
the lowest cut-off of 1 \FPKM\@.
Indeed, except for the following couples:
\begin{eqlist}[\eqliststarinit\def\makelabel#1{\bfseries#1}\labelsep1em]
\item[Heart] \uhlen{}-\gtex\ pair
\item[Kidney] \uhlen{}-\gtex, \castle{}-\uhlen\ and \castle{}-\gtex\ pairs,
\item[Liver]  \vt{}-\ibm, \ibm{}-\uhlen\ and \ibm{}-\uhlen\ pairs;
\item[Testis] \ibm{}-\uhlen, \vt{}-\gtex, \vt{}-\uhlen\ and \uhlen{}-\gtex\ pairs
\end{eqlist}
in most cases,
the correlation coefficients are increasing as the cut-off is lowered
(and that the calculations comprise more genes).

    common tissues across the 5 studies.}}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

In the context of the 23-tissues working set,
showed in \Cref{fig:CorHighExp23T},
many more tissue pairs present very high correlation for subsets of their highly
expressed genes, \ie\ \skeletal, \Thyroid, \Cortex, \Uterus, \Kidney.
Unfortunately, these specific examples are insuffisant
to able any consensual threshold to be derived for future work.

Moreover, the \kidney\ pairs aside,
for all the other tissues,
considering every protein gene expressed at least at 1 \FPKM\ is as good, when
not better, than including only the high expressed genes subset.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{transcriptomics/T23EvolHighExp23P-1.pdf}\centering

\label{fig:CorHighExp23T}\textbf{Pearson correlation coefficient evolution based
on the expression levels of the genes considered
for each of the 23 common tissues between \uhlen\ and \gtex.}}
\end{figure}

To ponder for the possible difference in the expression magnitude
across the studies\footnote{Due to particular batch effects in each study},
while the highest expressed \pc\ may have similar ranks
for a given tissue,
I have explored the ratio evolution of the common highest expressed
genes across the studies to the number of genes considered.

This hypothesis is backed by the Spearman correlations that are higher
than the Pearson ones.

\Cref{fig:highExpress4T} shows the cumulative ratios of the number of
common \pcgs\ in a given number of highest expressed \pcgs\
in each tissue across the studies to that very number.
Notice that for a minimal subset of the genes
(below 10 across all the tissues),
there are very high ratios which drop dramatically and increase slowly then
to reach the expected ratio of 1 as the \pcgs\ set
across the studies is identical.

\Cref{fig:highExpress23T} presents the same kind of ratios,
however, limited to \uhlen\ and \gtex\ solely.
Here as well, aside from the expected perfect ratio for the complete set of
\pcgs,
only a tiny subset of the highest expressed genes produce high ratios of
highly expressed common genes to the number of considered ranked genes.
These results are quite unsurprising as they involve only two studies.
In addition to increasing probabilistically the number of overlaps,
these two studies are also the two most recent ones
and they comprise a greater number of replicates per tissues;
thus the measures for each gene in each condition are likely more robust.

\NB\ The grey lines on \Cref{fig:highExpress4T,fig:highExpress23T} represent
the calculated ratios for the randomly permuted data.
They plainly show that across the assortment of studies,
the real data present common (biological) structures
that are not fortuitous.

While a study of the highly expressed \pcgs\ is interesting,
its potential ability on explaining the underlying reasons
of the strong interstudy tissue correlations seems limited at best
or even inadequate.
Thus, it is necessary to consider other fields of enquiry,
such as the most variable genes.

\subsection{Most variable genes}

Similar variation patterns in the expression of the \pcgs\
across the tissues within each dataset
may explain the strong variations.
They are several available estimators to describe the variability of a gene,
\eg\ the coefficient of variation.

\NB\ The same analysis involving the variance in lieu of
the coefficient of variation gives less insights into the correlation strength
between the tissues across the datasets.

The coefficient of variation allows assessing
the dispersion of the gene expression values
across the tissues within each dataset.
As it contextualises the values to the mean,
it is a more straightforward estimator to interpret than the standard variation,
in particular for interstudy comparisons.

Visualising the distribution of the coefficients of variation of
gene expression for the working set \setOne\ (see \Cref{fig:HistCV4T})
allows determining whether they are similar across the five transcriptomic studies
or that inferring conclusions requires cautions.
As the \cvs\ present the same pattern across the five studies,
it suggests that extra steps are non compulsory here.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{transcriptomics/distributionCV_4commonTissues.pdf}%
    \centering
    \caption[Coefficients of variation across the 5 studies for the set of common
expressed genes and tissues]{\label{fig:HistCV4T}\textbf{Distribution of the
\cvs\ (cv) across \setOne\ (5 studies, set of
common expressed \pcgs\ in the 4 common tissues:
\{\Heart, \Kidney, \Liver, \Testis\}).}\\
The coefficients of variation of the \pcgs\ (12,268) of the four tissues present
the same bimodal distribution profile across the five studies.
There are two pics:
one at $0.5$ and a second one at $2$ for the \cvs.
After more extensive investigation, it appears that
the genes with a \cv\ lesser than or equal to $0.5$ have expression profiles
similar to the complete set of genes as in \Cref{fig:distribPlot}, set apart
the truncated left side (due to the $1$ \FPKM\ cut-off).
On the other hand, the \pcgs\ with a coefficient of variation
equal to or greater than $1.5$ have two kind of distinct profiles:
{\small
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,nosep,leftmargin=95pt,listparindent=5pt]
    \item The gene expression is low across the four tissues and
        it is above the cut-off of $1$ \FPKM\ only once; or
    \item The gene expression is particularly high for one single tissue
        in regards to the three others.
\end{itemize}
}}
\end{figure}

The following analysis tests the difference of correlation
between the set of the commonly most variable genes of \setOne\ across the studies
and all the other remaining ones.
After ranking the \pcgs\ in decreasing order of their \cv\ within each study,
I select the intersection the most (top quarter) variable genes across them.
I use these first group of \pcgs\
to calculate the coefficients of correlation for all possible tissue couples
within \setOne.
The remaining genes are constituting a second group for
which I also compute the correlations for all possible combination of tissues.

If the most variable \pcgs\ are driving the correlation
then their group has to present higher correlation than the second one.
One-sided \Welchttest\footnote{See \Cref{mini:ttest}.}
at 95\% of confidence,
allows discarding the null hypothesis $H_0$ and
to state that the mean of the (Pearson and Spearman) correlation coefficients
calculated with the common most variable \pcgs\ are significantly greater than
the ones calculated with the remaining set of genes in \setOne\footnote{Though,
a two-sided \Welchttest\ compels to accept the $H_0$ hypothesis:\\
the two populations of coefficients correlation are not significantly different
(\pvalue{= 0.06594}).}, \eg\ for the Pearson correlations:
$mean_{most Variable}=0.76$ and $mean_{all Other Genes}=0.68$
(\pvalue{= 0.03295}).

\Cref{fig:test_mostvaribleVSevery} shows the distribution
of the correlation for these two groups of \pcgs.
Notice than either for the most variable genes group or the other,
the interstudy correlation of identical tissues of two different studies
are higher than any intrastudy correlation of different tissues.
However, the common \pcgs\ with the highest \cv\ discriminate better between
the identical and different tissues.

    Either for the most variables genes than for the other genes,
    the correlation between identical interstudy tissues are greater
    than any correlation between different (even intrastudy) tissues.}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:heatmapMost25pVariable,fig:ReverseheatmapMost25pVariable} present
respectively the heatmaps (with clusterings) of the tissues
based on their Spearman correlation for the most variable (\cv) \pcgs\
and all other remaining genes of \setOne.
The references tend to cluster by tissue rather than
by original study in both cases.
In fact, only the \castle\ tissues cluster by study
once the most variable genes are excluded.

While the most variable genes have a significant influence
on the strong and biological meaningful correlations,
there are other contributing genes.
In addition, it is worth mentioning that the results presented here
improve greatly when \uhlen\ and the \gtex\ studies are included.
Indeed, results for the preliminary sets
(without these two most recent studies)
are far worse.
Unsurprisingly,

\subsection{Curated sets}\label{subsec:Trans_curatedSets}
Protein coding genes that were characterised consistently
as any of the previous categories across the five datasets
are provided as supplementary data.


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Trans_discussion}
\TK{when I started no paper, now overloads}: list them and compare to my own
work. Meta-analysis\ldots

Small overlap of tissues: so scientifically not very good.
However, most of the genes expressed everywhere.
But, in general Biology >>> Technical.

Apart Castle but Castle method not really used any more. So it might be because of
the protocol which is harder to set up or not mature (maybe can be improved) or
maybe the method gives different measurements due to what it fishes and
normalisation methods which are not very good for that (biases).

Quite expectedly, as these analyses were incorporating more studies,
the results improved greatly.
Indeed, as I focalise the study on the shared genes across the studies,
I bias the analyses towards the genes with more robust expression profiles
that may be measured with \Rnaseq.




Petit blabla sur la normalisation (de nouveau), normalisation pas adapté
ERCC ptet 1 idée mais pas vraiment un internal standard.


New set of tissue spe.
Hampel method
Quantile normalisation\ldots

MAJ tissues spe de Tiger (ne pas oublier la discussion sur l'annotation)

tend vers une 1 limite mais pas mal de redéfinition


\TK{start speaking about the normalisation a bit, deseq, tpm, \ldots}

Ouverture: là, où au début on avait pas beaucoup de data avec des réplicats
biologiques pour le normal, on a commencé en avoir pas mal. Du coup, \nuno\
a analysé les genes avec un faible coeff de var. On a défini ca comme housekeeping
genes.
