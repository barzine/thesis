\Rough{
Gene expression, transcription, translation, regulation at each stage,
expected and reported correlation between transcripts and proteins
Measuring transcript expression by RNAseq, wet-lab part, analysis methods,
available large scale datasets on human tissues
Measuring protein expression by MS, data analysis – spectral counts, top 3, etc,
available large scale datasets on human tissues
The problem of comparing and integrating independent datasets, EBI’s GXA \\ \\
key concepts: DNA storage, RNA transfert of information and regulation,
protein effectors ==\textgreater phenotype
}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proteomics messy and noisy, challenging \ldots
    \item Transcriptomics seem a good proxy to study the phenotype => one kind of molecule made of the same pieces.
    \item Technology improved a lot from the microarrays to sequencing.
\end{itemize}
