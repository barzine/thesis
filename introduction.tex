When Asimov concluded with these words his chapter ``Beginning with bone'',
scientists had already started unfolding one of the most mesmerising biological
mystery: how does the Nature manage and organise the production of specific
effectors in specific locations. In other words how from one cell

Watson and Crick by publishing the double-helix structure of \DNA\
\citep{DNA1953} unlocked our path to understand the natural ways of storing and
manipulating the information. As the whole past six decades were packed with major
discoveries and technological achievements, there are many, fascinating,
milestones that could be discussed.
The following pages present a summary of the facts and techniques
that form the biological and technical context of the work backing this thesis.

As where the situation stands for now, we know that between the unique common
bluprint, which is the \DNA\ and the different phenotypes displayed by the tissues
comprising our bodies, they are many regulatory processes happening at different
layers (transcription, and translation).

    \item Proteomics messy and noisy, challenging \ldots
    \item Transcriptomics seem a good proxy to study the phenotype => one kind of molecule made of the same pieces.
    \item Technology improved a lot from the microarrays to sequencing.

\section{Capturing the expression in the laboratory}

Biological research uses mainly two approaches to
study the cell life intricacy and its underlying mechanisms.\\
The oldest approach is descriptive:


Small bits: corrections for \Rnaseq\ are already part of the analysis and
requires often as much flair than skills.
Contrarily to \Dnaseq\ where corrections can be applied \TK{add reference} and
then the analysis be done, in \Rnaseq each analysis requires a set of conform
quantification and normalisation methods.
While, there are quite established protocols for differential expression analysis,
there are presently many other downstream analyses that are cumbersome
and/or not settled yet. This is the case for this study.

\section{Aims of the thesis}

One main focus of my work for this thesis was to appraise the
consistency of findings that have been enlightened in normal Human tissues by
individual large scale transcriptomics and, more recently, large-scale
proteomics studies.

While the amount of data to process and integrate can be challenging,
paradoxically the data available to draw statistically significant conclusions
is often still too sparse. However, we do have enough to provide at least a
qualitative assessment of the consistency and evaluate the feasibility of a
quantitative assessment in general, if not, realise a quantitative integration
for a few key tissues.
