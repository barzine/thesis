\textbf{HS:}One of the earliest --- if not \emph{the} earliest --- questions historically
documented is the origins of Life. While mythologies and religions theses recorded
answer  these questions as early as History was recorded%
\TK{add first explanation of the origin of life ever recorded}

While we can not explain how life get on Earth or what was the first organism,
we have a clearer understanding on how Life evolve.


\Rough{%
Gene expression, transcription, translation, regulation at each stage,
expected and reported correlation between transcripts and proteins
Measuring transcript expression by RNAseq, wet-lab part, analysis methods,
available large scale datasets on human tissues
Measuring protein expression by MS, data analysis – spectral counts, top 3, etc,
available large scale datasets on human tissues
The problem of comparing and integrating independent datasets, EBI’s GXA \\ \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proteomics messy and noisy, challenging \ldots
    \item Transcriptomics seem a good proxy to study the phenotype => one kind of molecule made of the same pieces.
    \item Technology improved a lot from the microarrays to sequencing.
\end{itemize}
