## Tentative title: Investigating the consistency of expression. From Transcriptomics to Proteomics

1. Introduction
  11. Gene expression, transcription, translation, regulation at each stage, expected and reported correlation between transcripts and proteins 
  12. Measuring transcript expression by RNAseq, wet-lab part, analysis methods, available large scale datasets on human tissues
  13. Measuring protein expression by MS, data analysis – spectral counts, top 3, etc, available large scale datasets on human tissues
  14. The problem of comparing and integrating independent datasets, EBI’s GXA
2. Comparison of RNAseq datasets from large scale studies on normal human tissues
  21. The available datasets, which tissues, what’s common and what’s different in these (single/paired end, sequencing depth, sequence length etc), what are the overlaps among tissues, etc
  22. Approaches to compare the datasets
    221. Correlation between tissue expression across genes
    222. Correlation between gene expression across tissues
    223. Clustering of tissues
    224. Tissue specific (and tissue enriched genes) vs house-keeping genes (mentioning the problem that some tissues may be similar to each other and how to deal with this)
    225. Curated datasets
