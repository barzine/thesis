## Tentative title: Investigating the consistency of expression. From Transcriptomics to Proteomics

1- Introduction
11- Gene expression, transcription, translation, regulation at each stage, expected and reported correlation between transcripts and proteins 
12- Measuring transcript expression by RNAseq, wet-lab part, analysis methods, available large scale datasets on human tissues
13- Measuring protein expression by MS, data analysis – spectral counts, top 3, etc, available large scale datasets on human tissues
14- The problem of comparing and integrating independent datasets, EBI’s GXA
