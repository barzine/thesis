    Abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the
        transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs} and proteins.
            Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the
            entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale.
            Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein abundance
            and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than
            5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and protein levels
            correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives
            showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the
            first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and
            proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is
            predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with
            similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional
            properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and
            dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of
            gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a
            greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

    Abstract = {Co-expression networks have proven effective at assigning putative
        functions to genes based on the functional annotation of their
            co-expressed partners, in candidate gene prioritization studies and in
            improving our understanding of regulatory networks. The growing number
            of genome resequencing efforts and genome-wide association studies
            often identify loci containing novel genes and there is a need to infer
            their functions and interaction partners. To facilitate this we have
            expanded {GeneFriends,} an online database that allows users to
            identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This
            expansion entails an {RNA-seq-based} co-expression map that includes
            genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based
            co-expression maps, including over 10 000 non-coding {RNAs.}
        The results users obtain from {GeneFriends} include a co-expression network
            as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the
            co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database
            for different splice variants and {ncRNAs,} such as {microRNAs} and
            {lincRNAs.} Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts
        to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association
            approach. {GeneFriends} is freely available from
            {http://www.GeneFriends.org} and can be used to quickly identify and
        rank candidate targets relevant to the process or disease under study.},

    Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} methods for analyzing {RNA}
            populations {(RNA-Seq)} are gaining rapid application to many
            experimental situations. The steps in an {RNA-Seq} experiment
            require thought and planning, especially because the expense in
            time and materials is currently higher and the protocols are far
            less routine than those used for other high-throughput methods,
            such as microarrays. As always, good experimental design will make
            analysis and interpretation easier. Having a clear biological
            question, an idea about the best way to do the experiment,
            and an understanding of the number of replicates needed will make
            the entire process more satisfying. Whether the goal is capturing
            transcriptome complexity from a tissue or identifying small
            fragments of {RNA} cross-linked to a protein of interest,
            conversion of the {RNA} to {cDNA} followed by direct sequencing
            using the latest methods is a developing practice, with new
            technical modifications and applications appearing every day.
            Even more rapid are the development and improvement of methods
            for analysis of the very large amounts of data that arrive at
            the end of an {RNA-Seq} experiment, making considerations regarding
            reproducibility, validation, visualization, and interpretation
            increasingly important. This introduction is designed to review and
            emphasize a pathway of analysis from experimental design through data
            presentation that is likely to be successful, with the recognition
            that better methods are right around the corner.},

    Abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the
            biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized
            the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level
            through analysis of {RNA} deep sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} data across
            human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that
            roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed,
            contributing to around 75\% of all {mRNAs} by message copy number
            in most tissues. These {mRNAs} encoded proteins that were often
            intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism,
            transcription, {RNA} processing or translation. In contrast,
            genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally
            expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression
            levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
            concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates
            that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better
            with {qRT-PCR} data than estimates which also included 3'
            untranslated regions {(UTRs).} Muscle and liver had the least
            complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly
            ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a
            few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis
            expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of
            genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most
            expressed genes. {mRNAs} expressed in brain had unusually long
            {3'UTRs,} and mean {3'UTR} length was higher for genes involved in
            development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added
            complexity of {UTR-based} regulation for these genes. Our results
            support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a
            large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
            intracellular proteins.},

    Abstract = {Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various
        human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human
            physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics
            studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across
            tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the
            molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating
            comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a
            tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human
            transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent
            genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues.
            Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets,
            generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and
            postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different
            genome-wide analyses support a distribution in which many proteins
            are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted
            manner. Moreover, we discuss the applications of publicly available
            omics data for building genome-scale metabolic models, used for
            analyzing cell and tissue functions both in physiological and in

            sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse Th2 cells, coupled with a range of
            other techniques, to show that all genes can be separated, based on
            their expression abundance, into two distinct groups: one group

            and the other of highly expressed mRNAs
