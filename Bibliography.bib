  Abstract  = {Molecular Biology of the Cell is the classic in-depth text
               reference in cell biology. By extracting fundamental concepts
               and meaning from this enormous and ever-growing field, the
               authors tell the story of cell biology, and create a coherent
               framework through which non-expert readers may approach the
               subject. Written in clear and concise language, and illustrated
               with original drawings, the book is enjoyable to read, and
               provides a sense of the excitement of modern biology. Molecular
               Biology of the Cell not only sets forth the current
               understanding of cell biology (updated as of Fall 2001), but
               also explores the intriguing implications and possibilities of
               that which remains unknown.},

                transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs}
                and proteins.
                Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the
                entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale.
                Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein
                abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for
                more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and
                protein levels correlated better than previously thought,
                corresponding half-lives showed no correlation.
                Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first
                genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and
                proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is
                predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with
                similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional
                properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and
                dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of

    Abstract = {Co-expression networks have proven effective at assigning putative
        functions to genes based on the functional annotation of their
            co-expressed partners, in candidate gene prioritization studies and in
            improving our understanding of regulatory networks. The growing number
            of genome resequencing efforts and genome-wide association studies
            often identify loci containing novel genes and there is a need to infer
            their functions and interaction partners. To facilitate this we have
            expanded {GeneFriends,} an online database that allows users to
            identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This
            expansion entails an {RNA-seq-based} co-expression map that includes
            genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based
            co-expression maps, including over 10 000 non-coding {RNAs.}
        The results users obtain from {GeneFriends} include a co-expression network
            as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the
            co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database
            for different splice variants and {ncRNAs,} such as {microRNAs} and
            {lincRNAs.} Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts
        to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association
            approach. {GeneFriends} is freely available from
            {http://www.GeneFriends.org} and can be used to quickly identify and

    Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} methods for analyzing {RNA}
            populations {(RNA-Seq)} are gaining rapid application to many
            experimental situations. The steps in an {RNA-Seq} experiment
            require thought and planning, especially because the expense in
            time and materials is currently higher and the protocols are far
            less routine than those used for other high-throughput methods,
            such as microarrays. As always, good experimental design will make
            analysis and interpretation easier. Having a clear biological
            question, an idea about the best way to do the experiment,
            and an understanding of the number of replicates needed will make
            the entire process more satisfying. Whether the goal is capturing
            transcriptome complexity from a tissue or identifying small
            fragments of {RNA} cross-linked to a protein of interest,
            conversion of the {RNA} to {cDNA} followed by direct sequencing
            using the latest methods is a developing practice, with new
            technical modifications and applications appearing every day.
            Even more rapid are the development and improvement of methods
            for analysis of the very large amounts of data that arrive at
            the end of an {RNA-Seq} experiment, making considerations regarding
            reproducibility, validation, visualization, and interpretation
            increasingly important. This introduction is designed to review and
            emphasize a pathway of analysis from experimental design through data

            that better methods are right around the corner.},

    Abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the
            biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized
            the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level
            through analysis of {RNA} deep sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} data across
            human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that
            roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed,
            contributing to around 75\% of all {mRNAs} by message copy number
            in most tissues. These {mRNAs} encoded proteins that were often
            intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism,
            transcription, {RNA} processing or translation. In contrast,
            genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally
            expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression
            levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
            concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates
            that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better
            with {qRT-PCR} data than estimates which also included 3'
            untranslated regions {(UTRs).} Muscle and liver had the least
            complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly
            ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a
            few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis
            expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of
            genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most
            expressed genes. {mRNAs} expressed in brain had unusually long
            {3'UTRs,} and mean {3'UTR} length was higher for genes involved in
            development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added
            complexity of {UTR-based} regulation for these genes. Our results
            support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a
            large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed

        Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets,

    Abstract ={The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is one of the
        world-leading data repositories of mass spectrometry (MS)-based
            proteomics data. Since the beginning of 2014, PRIDE Archive
            (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) is the new PRIDE archival
            system, replacing the original PRIDE database. Here we summarize
            the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the
            previous update manuscript in the Database Issue in 2013. PRIDE
            Archive constitutes a complete redevelopment of the original PRIDE,
            comprising a new storage backend, data submission system and web
            interface, among other components. PRIDE Archive supports the
            most-widely used PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative) data
            standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements the data
            requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium.
            The wide adoption of ProteomeXchange within the community has
            triggered an unprecedented increase in the number of submitted data
            sets (around 150 data sets per month). We outline some statistics
            on the current PRIDE Archive data contents. We also report on the
            status of the PRIDE related stand-alone tools: PRIDE Inspector,
            PRIDE Converter 2 and the ProteomeXchange submission tool. Finally,
            we will give a brief update on the resources under development

    Abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular
        species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms
            due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a
            polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation
            sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues.
            ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far
            exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA
            methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses
            both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show
            enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC.
            Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher
            levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial
            than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed,
        particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi
            syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly
            expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater
            than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find
            novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries.
            This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates
            the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns,
        their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.},

    Title={Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes},
    Abstract={Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual
        mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may
        have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an
        in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes
        on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding
        a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which
        sequence reads are mapped to exon–exon junctions indicated that 92–94\% of
        human genes undergo alternative splicing, ~86\% with a minor isoform
        frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities
        indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and
        polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between
        individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme
        or ‘switch-like’ regulation of splicing between tissues was associated
        with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with
        generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative
        splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly
        correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these
        processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory
        motifs in both alternative introns and 3′ untranslated regions suggested
        common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both
        splicing and polyadenylation.},

                 analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently
                 prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the
                 sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten
                 species that represent all major mammalian lineages
                 (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the
                 evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the
                 dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that
                 the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs,
                 lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective
                 pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues
                 and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and
                 monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its
                 formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was
                 strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous
                 potentially selectively driven expression switches, which
                 occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and
                 which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of

            By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning
            about 350 million years of evolution, we observed significant
            differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate
            lineages, with the highest complexity in primates.
            Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically

            to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most
            vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed.
            However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to
            remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators.
            These events likely further contributed to the diversification of

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A vast amount of DNA variation is being identified by
              increasingly large-scale exome and genome sequencing projects. To
              be useful, variants require accurate functional annotation and a
              wide range of tools are available to this end. McCarthy et al
              recently demonstrated the large differences in prediction of
              loss-of-function (LoF) variation when RefSeq and Ensembl
              transcripts are used for annotation, highlighting the importance
              of the reference transcripts on which variant functional
              annotation is based. RESULTS: We describe a detailed analysis of
              the similarities and differences between the gene and transcript
              annotation in the GENCODE and RefSeq genesets. We demonstrate
              that the GENCODE Comprehensive set is richer in alternative
              splicing, novel CDSs, novel exons and has higher genomic coverage
              than RefSeq, while the GENCODE Basic set is very similar to
              RefSeq. Using RNAseq data we show that exons and introns unique
              to one geneset are expressed at a similar level to those common
              to both. We present evidence that the differences in gene
              annotation lead to large differences in variant annotation where
              GENCODE and RefSeq are used as reference transcripts, although
              this is predominantly confined to non-coding transcripts and UTR
              sequence, with at most ~30\% of LoF variants annotated
              discordantly. We also describe an investigation of dominant
              transcript expression, showing that it both supports the utility
              of the GENCODE Basic set in providing a smaller set of more
              highly expressed transcripts and provides a useful,
              biologically-relevant filter for further reducing the complexity
              of the transcriptome. CONCLUSIONS: The reference transcripts
              selected for variant functional annotation do have a large effect
              on the outcome. The GENCODE Comprehensive transcripts contain
              more exons, have greater genomic coverage and capture many more
              variants than RefSeq in both genome and exome datasets, while the
              GENCODE Basic set shows a higher degree of concordance with
              RefSeq and has fewer unique features. We propose that the GENCODE
              Comprehensive set has great utility for the discovery of new
              variants with functional potential, while the GENCODE Basic set
              is more suitable for applications demanding less complex
              interpretation of functional variants.},

  Abstract = {Sequencing the human genome gave new insights into human biology and disease.
      However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each
          of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of
          each protein. Uhl{\'e}n et al. now present a map of protein expression
          across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA
          level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the
          corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of
          expression patterns across the human body. Resolving the molecular
          details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of
          the human body would greatly increase our knowledge of human biology
          and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based

          well as an analysis of the expression profiles for all proteins
          targeted by pharmaceutical drugs and proteins implicated in cancer.
          RATIONALE We have used an integrative omics approach to study the
          spatial human proteome. Samples representing all major tissues and
          organs (n = 44) in the human body have been analyzed based on 24,028
          antibodies corresponding to 16,975 protein-encoding genes,
      complemented with RNA-sequencing data for 32 of the tissues. The antibodies
          have been used to produce more than 13 million tissue-based
          immunohistochemistry images, each annotated by pathologists for all
          sampled tissues. To facilitate integration with other biological
          resources, all data are available for download and cross-referencing.
          RESULTS: We report a genome-wide analysis of the tissue specificity of
          RNA and protein expression covering more than 90\% of the putative
          protein-coding genes, complemented with analyses of various subproteomes,
          such as predicted secreted proteins (n = 3171) and membrane-bound
          proteins (n = 5570). The analysis shows that almost half of the genes
          are expressed in all analyzed tissues, which suggests that the gene
          products are needed in all cells to maintain
          {\textquotedblleft}housekeeping{\textquotedblright} functions such as
      cell growth, energy generation, and basic metabolism. Furthermore, there is
          enrichment in metabolism among these genes, as 60\% of all metabolic
          enzymes are expressed in all analyzed tissues. The largest number of
          tissue-enriched genes is found in the testis, followed by the brain
          and the liver. Analysis of the 618 proteins targeted by clinically
          approved drugs unexpectedly showed that 30\% are expressed in all
          analyzed tissues. An analysis of metabolic activity based on
          genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS) revealed liver as the most
          metabolically active tissue, followed by adipose tissue and skeletal
          muscle.
          CONCLUSIONSA freely available interactive resource is presented as
          part of the Human Protein Atlas portal (www.proteinatlas.org),
          offering the possibility to explore the tissue-elevated proteomes
          in tissues and organs and to analyze tissue profiles for specific
          protein classes. Comprehensive lists of proteins expressed at elevated
          levels in the different tissues have been compiled to provide a spatial
          context with localization of the proteins in the subcompartments of
          each tissue and organ down to the single-cell level.The human
          tissue{\textendash}enriched proteins.All tissue-enriched proteins are
          shown for 13 representative tissues or groups of tissues, stratified
          according to their predicted subcellular localization. Enriched
          proteins are mainly intracellular in testis, mainly membrane bound in
          brain and kidney, and mainly secreted in pancreas and liver.Resolving
          the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues
          and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of
          human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue
          proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves
          quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined
          with tissue microarray{\textendash}based immunohistochemistry, to
          achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell
          level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90\% of the
          putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore
          the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome,
          the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different
          tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive
          Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins,
          as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major
         tissues and organs in the human body.},

  Abstract    = {Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of
                 loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the
                 mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown.
                 Most associated variants are not correlated with

    Abstract={Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing
        underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence
            data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to
            investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals
            and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional
            signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures
            are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most
            clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue
            and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high
            interindividual expression variation include disease candidates
            associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is
            the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing
            mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a
            more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its
            stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in
            defining individual phenotypes.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is subdivided
                 into different anatomical organs with many shared functions
                 and characteristics, but also distinct differences. We have
                 combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with
                 immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to describe the
                 gene and protein expression patterns that define the human
                 GIT. METHODS: RNA sequencing data derived from stomach,
                 duodenum, jejunum/ileum and colon specimens were compared to
                 gene expression levels in 23 other normal human tissues
                 analysed with the same method. Protein profiling based on
                 immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays was used to
                 sub-localize the corresponding proteins with GIT-specific
                 expression into sub-cellular compartments and cell types.
                 RESULTS: Approximately 75\% of all human protein-coding genes
                 were expressed in at least one of the GIT tissues. Only 51
                 genes showed enriched expression in either one of the GIT
                 tissues and an additional 83 genes were enriched in two or
                 more GIT tissues. The list of GIT-enriched genes with
                 validated protein expression patterns included various
                 well-known but also previously uncharacterised or poorly
                 studied genes. For instance, the colon-enriched expression of
                 NXPE family member 1 (NXPE1) was established, while NLR
                 family, pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6) expression was
                 primarily found in the human small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: We
                 have applied a genome-wide analysis based on transcriptomics
                 and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes that
                 are expressed in a specific manner within the human GIT. These
                 genes and proteins constitute important starting points for an
                 improved understanding of the normal function and the
                 different states of disease associated with the GIT.},

  Abstract    = {Protein noise measurements are increasingly used to elucidate
                 biophysical parameters. Unfortunately noise analyses are often
                 at odds with directly measured parameters. Here we show that
                 these inconsistencies arise from two problematic analytical
                 choices: (i) the assumption that protein translation rate is
                 invariant for different proteins of different abundances,
                 which has inadvertently led to (ii) the assumption that a
                 large constitutive extrinsic noise sets the low noise limit in
                 gene expression. While growing evidence suggests that
                 transcriptional bursting may set the low noise limit,
                 variability in translational bursting has been largely
                 ignored. We show that genome-wide systematic variation in
                 translational efficiency can-and in the case of E. coli
                 does-control the low noise limit in gene expression. Therefore
                 constitutive extrinsic noise is small and only plays a role in
                 the absence of a systematic variation in translational
                 efficiency. These results show the existence of two distinct
                 expression noise patterns: (1) a global noise floor uniformly
                 imposed on all genes by expression bursting; and (2) high
                 noise distributed to only a select group of genes.},

                 analysis by the scientific community. However, we were
                 intrigued by the number of protein-coding genes detected by
                 the two studies, numbers that far exceeded what has been
                 reported for the multinational Human Proteome Project effort.
                 We carried out a simple quality test on the data using the
                 olfactory receptor family. A high-quality proteomics
                 experiment that does not specifically analyze nasal tissues
                 should not expect to detect many peptides for olfactory
                 receptors. Neither of the studies carried out experiments on
                 nasal tissues, yet we found peptide evidence for more than 100
                 olfactory receptors in the two studies. These results suggest
                 that the two studies are substantially overestimating the
                 number of protein coding genes they identify. We conclude that
                 the experimental data from these two studies should be used
                 with caution.},

    Abstract={The completion of the sequencing of the human genome and the
        concurrent, rapid development of high-throughput proteomic methods have
            resulted in an increasing need for automated approaches to archive
            proteomic data in a repository that enables the exchange of data
            among researchers and also accurate integration with genomic data.
            PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) addresses these needs by
            identifying peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS),
        statistically validating those identifications and then mapping
            identified sequences to the genomes of eukaryotic organisms.
            A meaningful comparison of data across different experiments
            generated by different groups using different types of instruments
            is enabled by the implementation of a uniform analytic process.
            This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and
            high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications. The raw
            data from many diverse proteomic experiments are made available in
            the associated PeptideAtlas repository in several formats. Here we
            present a summary of our process and details about the Human,

        entirely new perspective for clinical research and will speed
            up personalized medicine. In contrast to microarray-based
            approaches, RNA-Seq analysis provides a much more
            comprehensive and unbiased view of gene expression. Although
            the perspective is clear and the long-term success of this new
            technology obvious, bioinformatics resources making these data
            easily available especially to the biomedical research
            community are still evolving. RESULTS: We have generated
            RNA-Seq Atlas, a web-based repository of RNA-Seq gene
            expression profiles and query tools. The website offers open
            and easy access to RNA-Seq gene expression profiles and tools
            to both compare tissues and find genes with specific
            expression patterns. To enlarge the scope of the RNA-Seq
            Atlas, the data were linked to common functional and genetic
            databases, in particular offering information on the
            respective gene, signaling pathway analysis and evaluation of
            biological functions by means of gene ontologies.
            Additionally, data were linked to several microarray gene
            profiles, including BioGPS normal tissue profiles and NCI60
            cancer cell line expression data. Our data search interface
            allows an integrative detailed comparison between our RNA-Seq
            data and the microarray information. This is the first
            database providing data mining tools and open access to large
            scale RNA-Seq expression profiles. Its applications will be
            versatile, as it will be beneficial in identifying tissue
            specific genes and expression profiles, comparison of gene
            expression profiles among diverse tissues, but also systems

  Abstract    = {Fast-evolving technologies have enabled researchers to easily
                 generate data at genome scale, and using these technologies to
                 compare biological states typically results in a list of
                 candidate genes. Researchers are then faced with the daunting
                 task of prioritizing these candidate genes for follow-up
                 studies. There are hundreds, possibly even thousands, of
                 web-based gene annotation resources available, but it quickly
                 becomes impractical to manually access and review all of these
                 sites for each gene in a candidate gene list. BioGPS
                 (http://biogps.org) was created as a centralized gene portal
                 for aggregating distributed gene annotation resources,
                 emphasizing community extensibility and user customizability.
                 BioGPS serves as a convenient tool for users to access known
                 gene-centric resources, as well as a mechanism to discover new
                 resources that were previously unknown to the user. This

  Author      = {Fonseca, Nuno A and Marioni, John and Brazma, Alvis},
  Abstract    = {Accurately quantifying gene expression levels is a key goal of
                 experiments using RNA-sequencing to assay the transcriptome.
                 This typically requires aligning the short reads generated to
                 the genome or transcriptome before quantifying expression of
                 pre-defined sets of genes. Differences in the
                 alignment/quantification tools can have a major effect upon
                 the expression levels found with important consequences for
                 biological interpretation. Here we address two main issues: do
                 different analysis pipelines affect the gene expression levels
                 inferred from RNA-seq data? And, how close are the expression
                 levels inferred to the ``true'' expression levels? We evaluate
                 fifty gene profiling pipelines in experimental and simulated
                 data sets with different characteristics (e.g, read length and
                 sequencing depth). In the absence of knowledge of the 'ground
                 truth' in real RNAseq data sets, we used simulated data to
                 assess the differences between the ``true'' expression and
                 those reconstructed by the analysis pipelines. Even though
                 this approach does not take into account all known biases
                 present in RNAseq data, it still allows to estimate the
                 accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by different
                 analysis pipelines. The results show that i) overall there is
                 a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by
                 the best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the
                 error in the estimated gene expression values can vary
                 considerably across genes; and iii) a small set of genes have
                 expression estimates with consistently high error (across data
                 sets and methods). Finally, although the mapping software is
                 important, the quantification method makes a greater
                 difference to the results.},

  Title       = {{HeLa} nucleic acid contamination in the cancer genome atlas
                 leads to the misidentification of human papillomavirus 18},
  Author      = {Cantalupo, Paul G and Katz, Joshua P and Pipas, James M},
  Abstract    = { We searched The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
                 database for viruses by comparing non-human reads present in
                 transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole-exome sequencing
                 (WXS) data to viral sequence databases. Human papillomavirus
                 18 (HPV18) is an etiologic agent of cervical cancer, and as
                 expected, we found robust expression of HPV18 genes in
                 cervical cancer samples. In agreement with previous studies,
                 we also found HPV18 transcripts in non-cervical cancer
                 samples, including those from the colon, rectum, and normal
                 kidney. However, in each of these cases, HPV18 gene expression
                 was low, and single-nucleotide variants and positions of
                 genomic alignments matched the integrated portion of HPV18
                 present in HeLa cells. Chimeric reads that match a known
                 virus-cell junction of HPV18 integrated in HeLa cells were
                 also present in some samples. We hypothesize that HPV18
                 sequences in these non-cervical samples are due to nucleic
                 acid contamination from HeLa cells. This finding highlights
                 the problems that contamination presents in computational
                 virus detection pipelines. IMPORTANCE: Viruses associated with
                 cancer can be detected by searching tumor sequence databases.
                 Several studies involving searches of the TCGA database have
                 reported the presence of HPV18, a known cause of cervical
                 cancer, in a small number of additional cancers, including
                 those of the rectum, kidney, and colon. We have determined
                 that the sequences related to HPV18 in non-cervical samples
                 are due to nucleic acid contamination from HeLa cells. To our
                 knowledge, this is the first report of the misidentification
                 of viruses in next-generation sequencing data of tumors due to
                 contamination with a cancer cell line. These results raise
                 awareness of the difficulty of accurately identifying viruses
                 in human sequence databases.},

  Abstract    = {Genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and
                 metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on
                 the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian
                 cells. At the same time, curation projects that organize
                 knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases
                 are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about
                 genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need
                 for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction
                 and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the
                 Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to
                 serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70
                 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized
                 data into ∼72 million functional associations between
                 genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be
                 physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in
                 cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout
                 mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug
                 treatment. We stored these associations in a relational
                 database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins,
                 their attributes and the original resources. The freely
                 available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user
                 interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying,
                 browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To
                 demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and
                 visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity
                 networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many
                 unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such
                 as the association between kinase perturbations and disease
                 signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning
                 methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous
                 ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for
                 knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane
                 proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome
                 is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and
                 proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover
                 novel relationships between biological entities, as well as
                 form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental
                 validation.Database URL:

                 simplified quality control (QC) system for RNA-seq data that
                 allows easy execution of several open-source QC tools,
                 aggregation of their output, and the ability to quickly
                 identify quality issues by performing meta-analyses on QC
                 metrics across large numbers of samples in different studies.
                 It comprises two main sections. First is the QC Pack wrapper,
                 which executes three QC tools: FastQC, RNA-SeQC, and selected
                 functions from RSeQC. Combining these three tools into one
                 wrapper provides increased ease of use and provides a much
                 more complete view of sample data quality than any individual
                 tool. Second is the QC database, which displays the resulting
                 metrics in a user-friendly web interface. It was designed to
                 allow users with less computational experience to easily
                 generate and view QC information for their data, to
                 investigate individual samples and aggregate reports of sample
                 groups, and to sort and search samples based on quality. The
                 structure of the QuaCRS database is designed to enable
                 expansion with additional tools and metrics in the future. The

                 alignment against a reference genome, which is the foundation
                 for all re-sequencing data analyses. Each new release of the
                 human reference genome has been augmented with improved
                 accuracy and completeness. It is presumed that the latest

                 estimates},
  Author      = {Williams, Claire R and Baccarella, Alyssa and Parrish, Jay Z
                 and Kim, Charles C},
  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has
                 become the preferred technique for studying gene expression
                 differences between biological samples and for discovering
                 novel isoforms, though the techniques to analyze the resulting
                 data are still immature. One pre-processing step that is
                 widely but heterogeneously applied is trimming, in which low
                 quality bases, identified by the probability that they are
                 called incorrectly, are removed. However, the impact of
                 trimming on subsequent alignment to a genome could influence
                 downstream analyses including gene expression estimation; we
                 hypothesized that this might occur in an inconsistent manner
                 across different genes, resulting in differential bias.
                 RESULTS: To assess the effects of trimming on gene expression,
                 we generated RNA-Seq data sets from four samples of larval
                 Drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons, and used three
                 trimming algorithms--SolexaQA, Trimmomatic, and ConDeTri-to
                 perform quality-based trimming across a wide range of
                 stringencies. After aligning the reads to the D. melanogaster
                 genome with TopHat2, we used Cuffdiff2 to compare the
                 original, untrimmed gene expression estimates to those
                 following trimming. With the most aggressive trimming
                 parameters, over ten percent of genes had significant changes
                 in their estimated expression levels. This trend was seen with
                 two additional RNA-Seq data sets and with alternative
                 differential expression analysis pipelines. We found that the
                 majority of the expression changes could be mitigated by
                 imposing a minimum length filter following trimming,
                 suggesting that the differential gene expression was primarily
                 being driven by spurious mapping of short reads. Slight
                 differences with the untrimmed data set remained after length
                 filtering, which were associated with genes with low exon
                 numbers and high GC content. Finally, an analysis of paired
                 RNA-seq/microarray data sets suggests that no or modest
                 trimming results in the most biologically accurate gene
                 expression estimates. CONCLUSIONS: We find that aggressive
                 quality-based trimming has a large impact on the apparent
                 makeup of RNA-Seq-based gene expression estimates, and that
                 short reads can have a particularly strong impact. We conclude
                 that implementation of trimming in RNA-Seq analysis workflows
                 warrants caution, and if used, should be used in conjunction
                 with a minimum read length filter to minimize the introduction
                 of unpredictable changes in expression estimates.},

  Abstract = {Three principal approaches have been proposed for inferring the
              set of transcripts expressed in RNA samples using RNA-seq. The
              simplest approach uses curated annotations, which assumes the
              transcripts in a sample are a subset of the transcripts listed in
              a curated database. A more ambitious method involves aligning
              reads to a reference genome and using the alignments to infer the
              transcript structures, possibly with the aid of a curated
              transcript database. The most challenging approach is to assemble
              reads into putative transcripts de novo without the aid of
              reference data. We have systematically assessed the properties of
              these three approaches through a simulation study. We have found
              that the sensitivity of computational transcript set estimation
              is severely limited. Computational approaches (both genome-guided
              and de novo assembly) produce a large number of artefacts, which
              are assigned large expression estimates and absorb a substantial
              proportion of the signal when performing expression analysis. The
              approach using curated annotations shows good expression
              correlation even when the annotations are incomplete.
              Furthermore, any incorrect transcripts present in a curated set
              do not absorb much signal, so it is preferable to have a curation
              set with high sensitivity than high precision. Software to

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are two
                 transcriptomics techniques aimed at the quantification of
                 transcribed genes and their isoforms. Here we compare the
                 latest Affymetrix HTA 2.0 microarray with Illumina 2000
                 RNA-seq for the analysis of patient samples - normal lung
                 epithelium tissue and squamous cell carcinoma lung tumours.
                 Protein coding mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were
                 included in the study. RESULTS: Both platforms performed
                 equally well for protein-coding RNAs, however the stochastic
                 variability was higher for the sequencing data than for
                 microarrays. This reduced the number of differentially
                 expressed genes and genes with predictive potential for
                 RNA-seq compared to microarray data. Analysis of this
                 variability revealed a lack of reads for short and low
                 abundant genes; lncRNAs, being shorter and less abundant RNAs,
                 were found especially susceptible to this issue. A major
                 difference between the two platforms was uncovered by analysis
                 of alternatively spliced genes. Investigation of differential
                 exon abundance showed insufficient reads for many exons and
                 exon junctions in RNA-seq while the detection on the array
                 platform was more stable. Nevertheless, we identified 207
                 genes which undergo alternative splicing and were consistently
                 detected by both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact
                 that the results of gene expression analysis were highly
                 consistent between Human Transcriptome Arrays and RNA-seq
                 platforms, the analysis of alternative splicing produced
                 discordant results. We concluded that modern microarrays can
                 still outperform sequencing for standard analysis of gene
                 expression in terms of reproducibility and cost.},

  Abstract    = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003,
                 extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing
                 technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase

                 sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential

                 sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is

                 digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts
                 from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference
                 measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair
                 reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver

                 transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of
                 transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude.
                 Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known

  Abstract    = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq is replacing microarrays as the primary
                 tool for gene expression studies. Many RNA-seq studies have
                 used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low
                 statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.
                 RESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more
                 biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing
                 power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the
                 human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M
                 reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes,
                 whereas adding biological replicates improves power
                 significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose
                 a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of
                 large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that
                 sequencing less reads and performing more biological
                 replication is an effective strategy to increase power and
                 accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq

                 the unexpected complexity and diversity of small RNAs. A
                 critical step in small RNA library preparation for sequencing
                 is the ligation of adapter sequences to both the 5' and 3'
                 ends of small RNAs. Studies have shown that adapter ligation
                 introduces a significant but widely unappreciated bias in the

                 due to this bias the two widely used Illumina library
                 preparation protocols produce strikingly different microRNA
                 (miRNA) expression profiles in the same batch of cells. There
                 are 102 highly expressed miRNAs that are >5-fold

                 bias in library preparation is not surprising, the apparent
                 massive differential bias between these two widely used
                 adapter sets is not well appreciated. In an attempt to
                 mitigate this bias, the new Bioo Scientific NEXTflex V2
                 protocol utilizes a pool of adapters with random nucleotides
                 at the ligation boundary. We show that this protocol is able
                 to detect robustly several miRNAs that evade capture by the
                 Illumina-based methods. While these analyses do not indicate a
                 definitive gold standard for small RNA library preparation,
                 the results of the NEXTflex protocol do correlate best with
                 RT-qPCR. As increasingly more laboratories seek to study small
                 RNAs, researchers should be aware of the extent to which the
                 results may differ with different protocols, and should make
                 an informed decision about the protocol that best fits their
                 study.},

  Abstract  = {Eukaryotic regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) play significant roles
               in many fundamental cellular processes. As such, they have
               emerged as useful biomarkers for diseases and cell
               differentiation states. sRNA-based biomarkers outperform
               traditional messenger RNA-based biomarkers by testing fewer
               targets with greater accuracy and providing earlier detection

               fundamentally important to further advance the understanding of
               biological processes, as well as diagnosis and treatment of
               diseases. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is a powerful

  Abstract    = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling
                 discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
                 Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
                 pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
                 human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
                 fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
                 compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
                 variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
                 billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment
                 at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat
                 surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic

                 deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to
                 generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of
                 this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X
                 chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the
                 genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We
                 build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth
                 of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand
                 structural variants, many of which were previously unknown.
                 Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical

This enables us to detect the presence and nucleotide sequence of viruses, or to build a picture of how active transcriptional processes are changing -- information that is useful for understanding the status and function of a sample. Nanopore-based sequencing technology is capable of electronically analysing a sample{\textquoteright}s DNA directly, and in real-time. In this manuscript we demonstrate the ability of an array of nanopores to sequence RNA directly, and we apply it to a range of biological situations. Nanopore technology is the only available sequencing technology which can sequence RNA directly, rather than depending on reverse transcription and PCR. There are several potential advantages of this approach over other RNA-seq strategies, including the absence of amplification and reverse transcription biases, the ability to detect nucleotide analogues and the ability to generate full-length, strand-specific RNA sequences. This will improve the ease and speed of RNA analysis, while yielding richer biological information.},

                 dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, fungi, viruses and bacteria.
                 Several studies have highlighted the importance of
                 coral-associated bacteria and their fundamental roles in
                 fitness and survival of the host animal. The scleractinian
                 coral Porites lutea is one of the dominant reef-builders in
                 the Indo-West Pacific. Currently, very little is known about
                 the composition and structure of bacterial communities across
                 P. lutea reefs. The purpose of this study is twofold: to
                 demonstrate the advantages of using PacBio circular consensus
                 sequencing technology in microbial community studies and to
                 investigate the diversity and structure of P. lutea-associated

                 study of marine environmental samples that utilises the PacBio
                 sequencing system to capture full-length 16S rRNA sequences.
                 We observed geographically distinct coral-associated microbial
                 profiles between samples from the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman
                 Sea. Despite the geographical and environmental impacts on the
                 coral-host interactions, we identified a conserved community
                 of bacteria that were present consistently across diverse reef
                 habitats. Finally, we demonstrated the superior performance of
                 full-length 16S rRNA sequences in resolving taxonomic

  Abstract    = {Downstream analyses of short-reads from next-generation
                 sequencing platforms are often preceded by a pre-processing
                 step that removes uncalled and wrongly called bases. Standard
                 approaches rely on their associated base quality scores to
                 retain the read or a portion of it when the score is above a
                 predefined threshold. It is difficult to differentiate
                 sequencing error from biological variation without a reference
                 using quality scores. The effects of quality score based
                 trimming have not been systematically studied in de novo
                 transcriptome assembly. Using RNA-Seq data produced from
                 Illumina, we teased out the effects of quality score based
                 filtering or trimming on de novo transcriptome reconstruction.
                 We showed that assemblies produced from reads subjected to

                 missing transfrags when compared to those from untrimmed
                 reads. Our data supports the fact that de novo assembling of
                 untrimmed data is challenging for de Bruijn graph assemblers.
                 However, our results indicates that comparing the assemblies
                 from untrimmed and trimmed read subsets can suggest
                 appropriate filtering parameters and enable selection of the

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The generation and analysis of high-throughput
                 sequencing data are becoming a major component of many studies
                 in molecular biology and medical research. Illumina's Genome
                 Analyzer (GA) and HiSeq instruments are currently the most
                 widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively
                 evaluate properties of genomic HiSeq and GAIIx data derived
                 from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95
                 to 150 bases. RESULTS: We provide quantifications and evidence
                 for GC bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of
                 quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By
                 combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates
                 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5\% of alignable bases.
                 While overall error rates are low in HiSeq data we observed
                 regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error
                 positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution errors.
                 Analyzing the forward and reverse strands separately revealed
                 error rates of up to 18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred
                 at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in
                 homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and
                 GC content was found depending on the GC content range.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The errors and biases we report have implications
                 for the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing
                 data. GAIIx and HiSeq data sets show slightly different error
                 profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize
                 downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous
                 recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion
                 to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance
                 polymorphisms.},

  Author      = {Wajid, Bilal and Serpedin, Erchin},
  Abstract    = {In the realm of bioinformatics and computational biology, the
                 most rudimentary data upon which all the analysis is built is
                 the sequence data of genes, proteins and RNA. The sequence
                 data of the entire genome is the solution to the genome
                 assembly problem. The scope of this contribution is to provide
                 an overview on the art of problem-solving applied within the
                 domain of genome assembly in the next-generation sequencing
                 (NGS) platforms. This article discusses the major genome
                 assemblers that were proposed in the literature during the
                 past decade by outlining their basic working principles. It is
                 intended to act as a qualitative, not a quantitative, tutorial
                 to all working on genome assemblers pertaining to the next
                 generation of sequencers. We discuss the theoretical aspects
                 of various genome assemblers, identifying their working
                 schemes. We also discuss briefly the direction in which the
                 area is headed towards along with discussing core issues on
                 software simplicity.},

  Abstract    = {HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of
                 transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads
                 from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme
                 based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the
                 Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes
                 for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each
                 alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid
                 extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for
                 the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each
                 representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and
                 simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system
                 currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any
                 other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
                 requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes
                 of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

  Abstract    = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data
                 is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
                 non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
                 lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                 technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
                 high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
                 limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large
                 (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
                 developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                 (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
                 alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
                 search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed
                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour
                 on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving
                 alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased
                 de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
                 non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and
                 is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using
                 Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
                 reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
                 intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,
                 corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
                 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a
                 standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software

                 been conducted, the question remains how individual methods
                 perform at accurately quantifying gene expression levels from
                 RNA-sequencing reads. We performed an independent benchmarking
                 study using RNA-sequencing data from the well established
                 MAQCA and MAQCB reference samples. RNA-sequencing reads were
                 processed using five workflows (Tophat-HTSeq,
                 Tophat-Cufflinks, STAR-HTSeq, Kallisto and Salmon) and
                 resulting gene expression measurements were compared to
                 expression data generated by wet-lab validated qPCR assays for
                 all protein coding genes. All methods showed high gene
                 expression correlations with qPCR data. When comparing gene
                 expression fold changes between MAQCA and MAQCB samples, about
                 85\% of the genes showed consistent results between
                 RNA-sequencing and qPCR data. Of note, each method revealed a
                 small but specific gene set with inconsistent expression
                 measurements. A significant proportion of these
                 method-specific inconsistent genes were reproducibly
                 identified in independent datasets. These genes were typically
                 smaller, had fewer exons, and were lower expressed compared to
                 genes with consistent expression measurements. We propose that
                 careful validation is warranted when evaluating RNA-seq based
                 expression profiles for this specific gene set.},

                 to human disease},
  Author      = {Robert, Christelle and Watson, Mick},
  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has emerged as the standard for measuring
                 gene expression and is an important technique often used in
                 studies of human disease. Gene expression quantification
                 involves comparison of the sequenced reads to a known genomic
                 or transcriptomic reference. The accuracy of that
                 quantification relies on there being enough unique information
                 in the reads to enable bioinformatics tools to accurately
                 assign the reads to the correct gene. RESULTS: We apply 12
                 common methods to estimate gene expression from RNA-Seq data
                 and show that there are hundreds of genes whose expression is
                 underestimated by one or more of those methods. Many of these
                 genes have been implicated in human disease, and we describe
                 their roles. We go on to propose a two-stage analysis of
                 RNA-Seq data in which multi-mapped or ambiguous reads can
                 instead be uniquely assigned to groups of genes. We apply this
                 method to a recently published mouse cancer study, and
                 demonstrate that we can extract relevant biological signal
                 from data that would otherwise have been discarded.
                 CONCLUSIONS: For hundreds of genes in the human genome,
                 RNA-Seq is unable to measure expression accurately. These
                 genes are enriched for gene families, and many of them have
                 been implicated in human disease. We show that it is possible
                 to use data that may otherwise have been discarded to measure
                 group-level expression, and that such data contains
                 biologically relevant information.},

              from protein coding loci, and that often the same major
              transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a high degree
              of overlap between the set of major transcripts and a recently
              published set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are
              predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data. Thus, we
              hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may play a
              functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main
              contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a
              non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the
              major transcript does not code a protein. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding
              loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all the
              transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are
              equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This
              observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in
              proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the
              detected changes in variation studies.},

                 sequencing using next-generation sequencing platforms is
                 rapidly becoming accepted as a tool for measuring gene
                 expression for both research and clinical use. Fresh frozen
                 (FF) tissue specimens of GBM are difficult to obtain since
                 tumor tissue obtained at surgery is often scarce and necrotic
                 and diagnosis is prioritized over freezing. After diagnosis,
                 leftover tissue is usually stored as formalin-fixed
                 paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. However, RNA from FFPE
                 tissues is usually degraded, which could hamper gene
                 expression analysis. We compared RNA-Seq data obtained from
                 matched pairs of FF and FFPE GBM specimens. Only three FFPE
                 out of eleven FFPE-FF matched samples yielded informative
                 results. Several quality-control measurements showed that RNA
                 from FFPE samples was highly degraded but maintained
                 transcriptomic similarities to RNA from FF samples. Certain
                 issues regarding mutation analysis and subtype prediction were
                 detected. Nevertheless, our results suggest that RNA-Seq of
                 FFPE GBM specimens provides reliable gene expression data that
                 can be used in molecular studies of GBM if the RNA is

                 prognostic gene signatures},
  Author      = {Zwiener, Isabella and Frisch, Barbara and Binder, Harald},
  Abstract    = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for
                 building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short
                 list of important genes that can predict patient outcome.
                 Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there
                 is little advice available for building multivariable risk
                 prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider
                 penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and
                 componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all
                 measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models
                 for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they
                 might be affected by the typical skewness,
                 mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq
                 covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of
                 the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential
                 selection of covariates with large variances, which is
                 problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq
                 data. In a simulation study, we compare different
                 transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving
                 detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider
                 standardization, the log transformation, a
                 variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox
                 transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition,
                 the prediction performance for real data from patients with
                 kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We
                 show that signature size, identification performance, and
                 prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a
                 suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform
                 well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex
                 variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results
                 illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations
                 of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when
                 building risk prediction models by penalized regression

                 sets produced by the sequencers create a need for development
                 of statistical and computational methods that can tackle the
                 analysis and management of data. The data normalization is one
                 of the most crucial steps of data processing and this process

  Abstract    = {The sequencing of the full transcriptome (RNA-seq) has become
                 the preferred choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene
                 expression. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain in
                 RNA-seq data analysis. One often-overlooked aspect is
                 normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of factors or
                 'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data,
                 commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for
                 sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly
                 problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety
                 of biological factors in addition to the one of interest.
                 Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that
                 batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that
                 the choice of normalization method affects the power and
                 reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global
                 normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the
                 data, more recently developed RNA-seq normalization can. We
                 focus on one particular method, RUVSeq and show that it is

                 Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of
                 RUVSeq normalization that is applicable to a broad range of

  Abstract    = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale
                 is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular
                 biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted
                 this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of
                 variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a
                 decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The
                 recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has
                 generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced
                 variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show
                 that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring
                 variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays.
                 In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content)
                 has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression
                 measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false
                 positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly
                 observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data
                 normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology
                 that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our
                 resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm
                 combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic
                 bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content
                 and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

  Abstract    = {Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven
                 essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels.
                 Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly
                 account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library
                 preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects.
                 We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control
                 Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the
                 possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show
                 that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in
                 standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization
                 procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
                 unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical
                 effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of
                 control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g.,
                 replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate
                 estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
                 expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.
                 In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large
                 collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories,
                 technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

                 analysis of digital gene expression data},
  Author      = {Robinson, Mark D and McCarthy, Davis J and Smyth, Gordon K},
  Abstract    = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression
                 (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in
                 the near future for many functional genomics applications. One
                 of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
                 expression studies, involves determining whether there is
                 evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                 significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR
                 is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
                 expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
                 model is used to account for both biological and technical
                 variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
                 degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the
                 reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even
                 with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least
                 one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
                 software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
                 such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package

  Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental

  Abstract    = {Targeted proteomics technique has emerged as a powerful
                 protein quantification tool in systems biology, biomedical
                 research, and increasing for clinical applications. The most
                 widely used targeted proteomics approach, selected reaction
                 monitoring (SRM), also known as multiple reaction monitoring
                 (MRM), can be used for quantification of cellular signaling
                 networks and preclinical verification of candidate protein
                 biomarkers. As an extension to our previous review on advances
                 in SRM sensitivity (Shi et al., Proteomics, 12, 1074-1092,
                 2012) herein we review recent advances in the method and
                 technology for further enhancing SRM sensitivity (from 2012 to
                 present), and highlighting its broad biomedical applications
                 in human bodily fluids, tissue and cell lines. Furthermore, we
                 also review two recently introduced targeted proteomics
                 approaches, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and
                 data-independent acquisition (DIA) with targeted data
                 extraction on fast scanning high-resolution accurate-mass
                 (HR/AM) instruments. Such HR/AM targeted quantification with
                 monitoring all target product ions addresses SRM limitations
                 effectively in specificity and multiplexing; whereas when
                 compared to SRM, PRM and DIA are still in the infancy with a
                 limited number of applications. Thus, for HR/AM targeted
                 quantification we focus our discussion on method development,
                 data processing and analysis, and its advantages and
                 limitations in targeted proteomics. Finally, general
                 perspectives on the potential of achieving both high
                 sensitivity and high sample throughput for large-scale
                 quantification of hundreds of target proteins are discussed.},

  Abstract    = {One of the most important early developments in the field of
                 proteomics was the advent of automated data acquisition
                 routines that allowed high-throughput unattended data
                 acquisition during HPLC introduction of peptide mixtures to a
                 tandem mass spectrometer. Prior to this, data acquisition was
                 orders of magnitude less efficient being based entirely on
                 lists of predetermined ions generated in a prior HPLC-MS
                 experiment. This process, known generically as data-dependent
                 analysis, empowered the development of shotgun proteomics
                 where hundreds to thousands of peptide sequences are matched
                 per experiment. In their most popular implementation, the most
                 abundant ionized species from every precursor ion scan at each
                 moment in chromatographic time are successively selected for
                 isolation, activation and tandem mass analysis. While
                 extremely powerful, this strategy has one primary limitation
                 in that detectable dynamic range is restricted (in a top-down
                 manner) to the peptides that ionize the best. To circumvent
                 the serial nature of the data-dependent process and increase
                 detectable dynamic range, the concepts of multiplexed and
                 data-independent acquisition (DIA) have emerged.
                 Multiplexed-data acquisition is based on more efficient
                 co-selection and co-dissociation of multiple precursor ions in
                 parallel, the data from which is subsequently de-convoluted to
                 provide polypeptide sequences for each individual precursor
                 ion. DIA has similar goals, but there is no real-time ion
                 selection based on prior precursor ion scans. Instead,
                 predefined m/z ranges are interrogated either by fragmenting
                 all ions entering the mass spectrometer at every single point
                 in chromatographic time; or by dividing the m/z range into
                 smaller m/z ranges for isolation and fragmentation. These
                 approaches aim to fully utilize the capabilities of mass
                 spectrometers to maximize tandem MS acquisition time and to
                 address the need to expand the detectable dynamic range, lower
                 the limit of detection, and improve the overall confidence of
                 peptide identifications and relative protein quantification
                 measurements. This review covers all aspects of multiplexed-
                 and data-independent tandem mass spectrometry in proteomics,

  Abstract    = {MOTIVATION: Mass spectrometry is a complex technique used for
                 large-scale protein profiling with clinical and pharmaceutical
                 applications. While individual components in the system have
                 been studied extensively, little work has been done to
                 integrate various modules and evaluate them from a systems
                 point of view. RESULTS: In this work, we investigate this
                 problem by putting together the different modules in a typical
                 proteomics work flow, in order to capture and analyze key
                 factors that impact the number of identified peptides and
                 quantified proteins, protein quantification error,
                 differential expression results, and classification
                 performance. The proposed proteomics pipeline model can be
                 used to optimize the work flow as well as to pinpoint critical
                 bottlenecks worth investing time and resources into for
                 improving performance. Using the model-based approach proposed
                 here, one can study systematically the critical problem of
                 proteomic biomarker discovery, by means of simulation using

  Abstract    = {The vast majority of proteomic studies to date have relied on
                 mass spectrometric techniques to identify, and in some cases

                 identification is crucial for the optimization of proteomics
                 experiments, but few studies have addressed this matter.
                 Herein, we present a systematic study using a replicate run
                 strategy to probe the inherent influence of both peptide
                 physicochemical properties and matrix effects on the
                 relationship between peptide identification and sample loading
                 amounts, as well as its applications in protein
                 quantification. Ten replicate runs for a series of laddered
                 loading amounts (ranging between 0.01 approximately 10 microg)
                 of total digested proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
                 performed with nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with
                 linear ion trap/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
                 (nanoLC-LTQ-FT) to obtain a nearly saturated peptide
                 identification. This permitted us to differentiate the linear
                 correlativity of peptide identification by the commonly used
                 peptide quantitative index, the area of constructed ion
                 chromatograms (XIC) (SA, from MS and tandem MS data) in the
                 given experiments. The absolute loading amount of a given
                 complex sample affected the final qualitative identification
                 result; thus, optimization of the sample loading amount before
                 every proteomics study was essential. Peptide physicochemical
                 properties had little effect on the linear correlativity
                 between SA-based peptide quantification and loading amount.
                 The matrix effects, rather than the static physicochemical
                 properties of individual peptides, affect peptide
                 measurability. We also quantified the target protein by
                 selecting peptides with good parallel linear correlativity
                 based upon SA as signature peptides and revised the data by
                 multiplying by the reciprocal of the slope coefficient. We
                 found that this optimized the linear protein abundance
                 relativity at every amount range and thus extended the linear
                 dynamic range of label-free quantification. This empirical
                 rule for linear peptide selection (ERLPS) can be adopted to
                 correct comparison results in proteolytic peptide-based
                 quantitative proteomics, such as accurate mass tag (AMT) and
                 targeted quantitative proteomics, as well as in tag-labeled

  Abstract    = {The determination of peptides and proteins in a biological
                 matrix normally includes a sample-preparation step to obtain a
                 sample that can be injected into a separation system in such a
                 way that peptides and proteins of interest can be determined
                 qualitatively and/or quantitatively. This can be a rather
                 challenging, labourious and/or time-consuming process. The
                 extract obtained after sample preparation is further separated
                 using a compatible separation system. Liquid chromatography
                 (LC) is the generally applied technique for this purpose, but
                 capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is an alternative,
                 providing fast, versatile and efficient separations. In this
                 review, the recent developments in the combination of
                 sample-preparation procedures with LC and CZE, for the
                 determination of peptides and proteins, will be discussed.
                 Emphasis will be on purification from and determination in
                 complex biological matrices (plasma, cell lysates, etc.) of
                 these compounds and little attention will be paid to the
                 proteomics area. Additional focus will be put on
                 sample-preparation conditions, which can be 'hard' or 'soft',
                 and on selectivity issues. Selectivity issues will be
                 addressed in combination with the used separation technique
                 and a comparison between LC and CZE will be made.},

  Author      = {Hilbrig, Frank and Freitag, Ruth},
  Abstract    = {Developing the most efficient strategy for the purification of
                 a (recombinant) protein especially at large scale remains a
                 challenge. A typical problem of the downstream process of
                 mammalian cell products is, for instance, the early capture of
                 the highly diluted product from the complex process stream.
                 Affinity precipitation has been suggested in this context. The
                 technique is known for over 20 years, but has recently
                 received more attention due to the development of new
                 materials for its implementation, but also because it seems
                 ideally suited to specific product capture at large scale. The
                 present review gives a comprehensive overview over this
                 technique. Besides an introduction to the basic principle and
                 a brief summary of the historical development, the main focus
                 is on the current state-of-art of the technique, the available
                 materials, important recent applications, as well as process
                 design strategies and operating procedures. Special
                 consideration is given to affinity precipitation for product
                 recovery at large scale.},

  Abstract  = {Quantification of individual proteins and even entire proteomes
               is an important theme in proteomics research. Quantitative
               proteomics is an approach to obtain quantitative information
               about proteins in a sample. Compared to qualitative or
               semi-quantitative proteomics, this approach can provide more
               insight into the effects of a specific stimulus, such as a
               change in the expression level of a protein and its
               posttranslational modifications, or to a panel of proposed
               biomarkers in a given disease state. Proteomics methodologies,
               along with a variety of bioinformatics approaches, are a major
               tool in quantitative proteomics. As the theory and technological
               aspects underlying the proteomics methodologies will be

               a prerequisite of quantification has been discussed in Chap. 17,

               algorithms and software tools in this chapter. Our goal is to
               provide researchers and newcomers a rational framework to select

                 fingerprinting},
  Author      = {Pappin, D J and Hojrup, P and Bleasby, A J},
  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Developments in 'soft' ionisation techniques have
                 revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the analysis
                 of protein structure. For more than a decade, such techniques
                 have been used, in conjuction with digestion b specific
                 proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular weight
                 'fingerprints' of proteins. These fingerprints have commonly
                 been used to screen known proteins, in order to detect errors
                 of translation, to characterize post-translational
                 modifications and to assign diulphide bonds. However, the
                 extent to which peptide-mass information can be used alone to
                 identify unknown sample proteins, independent of other
                 analytical methods such as protein sequence analysis, has
                 remained largely unexplored. RESULTS: We report here on the
                 development of the molecular weight search (MOWSE)
                 peptide-mass database at the SERC Daresbury Laboratory.
                 Practical experience has shown that sample proteins can be
                 uniquely identified from a few as three or four experimentally
                 determined peptide masses when these are screened against a
                 fragment database that is derived from over 50 000 proteins.
                 Experimental errors of a few Daltons are tolerated by the
                 scoring algorithms, thus permitting the use of inexpensive
                 time-of-flight mass spectrometers. As with other types of
                 physical data, such as amino-acid composition or linear
                 sequence, peptide masses provide a set of determinants that
                 are sufficiently discriminating to identify or match unknown
                 sample proteins. CONCLUSION: Peptide-mass fingerprints can
                 prove as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can
                 be obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In
                 many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a sample
                 protein before committing it to protein sequence analysis.
                 Fragment masses also provide information, at the protein
                 level, that is complementary to the information provided by
                 large-scale DNA sequencing or mapping projects.},

  Abstract    = {Mass spectrometry-based methods allow for the direct,
                 comprehensive analysis of expressed proteins and their
                 quantification among different conditions. However, in general
                 identification of proteins by assigning experimental mass
                 spectra to peptide sequences of proteins relies on matching
                 mass spectra to theoretical spectra derived from genomic
                 databases of organisms. This conventional approach limits the
                 applicability of proteomic methodologies to species for which
                 a genome reference sequence is available. Recently,
                 RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) became a valuable tool to overcome
                 this limitation by de novo construction of databases for
                 organisms for which no DNA sequence is available, or by
                 refining existing genomic databases with transcriptomic data.
                 Here we present a generic pipeline to make use of
                 transcriptomic data for proteomics experiments. We show in
                 particular how to efficiently fuel proteomic analysis
                 workflows with sample-specific RNA-sequencing databases. This
                 approach is useful for the proteomic analysis of so far
                 unsequenced organisms, complex microbial
                 metatranscriptomes/metaproteomes (for example in the human
                 body), and for refining current proteomics data analysis that
                 solely relies on the genomic sequence and predicted gene
                 expression but not on validated gene products. Finally, the
                 approach used in the here presented protocol can help to
                 improve the data quality of conventional proteomics
                 experiments that can be influenced by genetic variation or
                 splicing events.},

               Applications},
  Author    = {Haag, Anthony M},
  Abstract  = {Mass spectrometers are comprised of three main components: an
               ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. Ionization of the
               analyte occurs in the ion source and the resulting ions are
               counted at the detector. However, it is the mass analyzer that
               is responsible for determing the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of
               the ions (Jennings KR, Dolnikowski GG, Method Enzymol 193:37–61,
               1990). Therefore, it is primarily the analyzer that allows the
               mass spectrometer to serve its primary goal – determining the
               mass of the analytes being measured. This becomes important in
               the field of molecular biology, where biomolecules may be of low
               molecular weight or often take on multiple charges (z) after
               ionization (Fenn JB, Mann M, Meng CK, Wong SF, Whitehouse CM,
               Science 246:64–71, 1989). For this reason, the choice of
               analyzer is dependant on the properties of the analyte after
               ionization and the requirements of the experiment being
               performed.},

  Author    = {Makarov, Alexander},
  Abstract  = {This work describes a new type of mass analyzer which employs
               trapping in an electrostatic field. The potential distribution
               of the field can be represented as a combination of quadrupole
               and logarithmic potentials. In the absence of any magnetic or rf
               fields, ion stability is achieved only due to ions orbiting
               around an axial electrode. Orbiting ions also perform harmonic
               oscillations along the electrode with frequency proportional to
               (m/z)-1/2. These oscillations are detected using image current
               detection and are transformed into mass spectra using fast FT,
               similarly to FT ICR. Practical aspects of the trap design are
               presented. High-mass resolution up to 150 000 for ions produced
               by laser ablation has been demonstrated, along with high-energy

  Title       = {The Orbitrap: a new mass spectrometer},
  Author      = {Hu, Qizhi and Noll, Robert J and Li, Hongyan and Makarov,
                 Alexander and Hardman, Mark and Graham Cooks, R},
  Abstract    = {Research areas such as proteomics and metabolomics are driving
                 the demand for mass spectrometers that have high performance
                 but modest power requirements, size, and cost. This paper
                 describes such an instrument, the Orbitrap, based on a new
                 type of mass analyzer invented by Makarov. The Orbitrap
                 operates by radially trapping ions about a central spindle
                 electrode. An outer barrel-like electrode is coaxial with the
                 inner spindlelike electrode and mass/charge values are
                 measured from the frequency of harmonic ion oscillations,
                 along the axis of the electric field, undergone by the
                 orbitally trapped ions. This axial frequency is independent of
                 the energy and spatial spread of the ions. Ion frequencies are
                 measured non-destructively by acquisition of time-domain image
                 current transients, with subsequent fast Fourier transforms
                 (FFTs) being used to obtain the mass spectra. In addition to
                 describing the Orbitrap mass analyzer, this paper also
                 describes a complete Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer,
                 equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). Ions
                 are transferred from the ESI source through three stages of
                 differential pumping using RF guide quadrupoles. The third
                 quadrupole, pressurized to less than 10(-3) Torr with
                 collision gas, acts as an ion accumulator; ion/neutral
                 collisions slow the ions and cause them to pool in an axial
                 potential well at the end of the quadrupole. Ion bunches are
                 injected from this pool into the Orbitrap analyzer for mass
                 analysis. The ion injection process is described in a
                 simplified way, including a description of electrodynamic
                 squeezing, field compensation for the effects of the ion
                 injection slit, and criteria for orbital stability. Features
                 of the Orbitrap at its present stage of development include
                 high mass resolution (up to 150,000), large space charge
                 capacity, high mass accuracy (2-5 ppm), a mass/charge range of
                 at least 6000, and dynamic range greater than 10(3).
                 Applications based on electrospray ionization are described,
                 including characterization of transition-metal complexes,
                 oligosaccharides, peptides, and proteins. Use is also made of
                 the high-resolution capabilities of the Orbitrap to confirm
                 the presence of metaclusters of serine octamers in ESI mass
                 spectra and to perform H/D exchange experiments on these ions
                 in the storage quadrupole.},

                 performed on yeast cell extracts that were introduced into the
                 mass spectrometer by using flow injection analysis, with an
                 acquisition time of 3 min. Typical mass spectra contained a
                 few thousand m/z signals, 400 of which were found to be
                 analytically relevant (i.e., their intensity was 3-fold higher
                 than that of the background noise and they occurred in at
                 least 60\% of the acquisition profiles under identical
                 experimental conditions). The method was validated by studies
                 of the matrix effect, linearity, and intra-assay precision.
                 Accurate mass measurements in the Orbitrap discriminated
                 between isobaric ions and also indicated the elemental
                 composition of the ions of interest with mass errors below 5

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The reliable extraction of features from mass
                 spectra is a fundamental step in the automated analysis of
                 proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. RESULTS: This
                 contribution proposes a sparse template regression approach to
                 peak picking called NITPICK. NITPICK is a Non-greedy,
                 Iterative Template-based peak PICKer that deconvolves complex
                 overlapping isotope distributions in multicomponent mass
                 spectra. NITPICK is based on fractional averaging, a novel
                 extension to Senko's well-known averaging model, and on a
                 modified version of sparse, non-negative least angle
                 regression, for which a suitable, statistically motivated
                 early stopping criterion has been derived. The strength of
                 NITPICK is the deconvolution of overlapping mixture mass
                 spectra. CONCLUSION: Extensive comparative evaluation has been
                 carried out and results are provided for simulated and
                 real-world data sets. NITPICK outperforms pepex, to date the
                 only alternate, publicly available, non-greedy feature
                 extraction routine. NITPICK is available as software package

  Abstract    = {MaxQuant is one of the most frequently used platforms for
                 mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data analysis. Since
                 its first release in 2008, it has grown substantially in
                 functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS
                 platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the
                 most important basic computational workflows, including those
                 designed for quantitative label-free proteomics, MS1-level
                 labeling and isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol
                 presents a complete description of the parameters used in
                 MaxQuant, as well as of the configuration options of its
                 integrated search engine, Andromeda. This protocol update
                 describes an adaptation of an existing protocol that
                 substantially modifies the technique. Important concepts of
                 shotgun proteomics and their implementation in MaxQuant are
                 briefly reviewed, including different quantification
                 strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as
                 well as the analysis of post-translational modifications
                 (PTMs). The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information
                 about quantification of proteins and PTMs, are explained in
                 detail. Furthermore, we provide a short version of the
                 workflow that is applicable to data sets with simple and
                 standard experimental designs. The MaxQuant algorithms are
                 efficiently parallelized on multiple processors and scale well
                 from desktop computers to servers with many cores. The

                 are many different search engines, both commercial and open

                 proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological
                 samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses
                 a different proprietary binary output file format, which has
                 hindered data sharing and the development of open source
                 software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to
                 develop, with the full participation of academic researchers
                 as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based
                 format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then

              provide a standard output format for mass spectrometry data that
              will facilitate data sharing and analysis. Initially, the efforts
              to develop a standard format for mass spectrometry data resulted
              in multiple formats, each designed with a different underlying
              philosophy. To resolve the issues associated with having multiple
              formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened
              under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard.
              The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical
              attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number
              of improvements, including features such as a controlled
              vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of
              the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring
              data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate
              rapid adoption by the community. The resulting standard data

  Abstract    = {The increasing scale and complexity of quantitative proteomics

                 Untargeted label-free quantification, based either on feature
                 intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that scales
                 particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is
                 thus an excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order
                 to profit from this scalability, however, data analysis has to
                 cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically,
                 and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve
                 reliable results. We review the state of the art with respect
                 to computational tools for label-free quantification in
                 untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are
                 feature-based quantification, relying on the summed-up mass
                 spectrometric intensity of peptides, and spectral counting,
                 which relies on the number of MS/MS spectra acquired for a
                 certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches

  Title = {Improving GENCODE reference gene annotation using a high-stringency
          proteogenomics workflow},
  Abstract={Complete annotation of the human genome is indispensable for
          medical research. The GENCODE consortium strives to provide this,
          augmenting computational and experimental evidence with manual annotation.
          The rapidly developing field of proteogenomics provides evidence for the
          translation of genes into proteins and can be used to discover and refine
          gene models. However, for both the proteomics and annotation groups,
          there is a lack of guidelines for integrating this data. Here we report
          a stringent workflow for the interpretation of proteogenomic data that
          could be used by the annotation community to interpret novel proteogenomic
          evidence. Based on reprocessing of three large-scale publicly available
          human data sets, we show that a conservative approach, using stringent
          filtering is required to generate valid identifications. Evidence has
          been found supporting 16 novel protein-coding genes being added to GENCODE.
          Despite this many peptide identifications in pseudogenes cannot be
          annotated due to the absence of orthogonal supporting evidence.},

  Abstract    = {Proteogenomics leverages information derived from proteomic
                 data to improve genome annotations. Of particular interest are
                 ``novel'' peptides that provide direct evidence of protein
                 expression for genomic regions not previously annotated as

                 pipeline aimed at detecting such ``novel'' peptides in
                 proteomic data sets. This pipeline implements criteria
                 developed by proteomics and genome annotation experts for
                 high-stringency peptide identification and filtering. Our

              sequences have been curated by experts who critically review
              experimental and predicted data for each protein. The remainder
              are automatically annotated based on rule systems that rely on
              the expert curated knowledge. Since our last update in 2014, we
              have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631,
              giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemented
              a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were
              causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this

                 approximately 0.6 among the three quantification methods was

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry (MS) based label-free protein
                 quantitation has mainly focused on analysis of ion peak
                 heights and peptide spectral counts. Most analyses of tandem
                 mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data begin with an enzymatic
                 digestion of a complex protein mixture to generate smaller
                 peptides that can be separated and identified by an MS/MS
                 instrument. Peptide spectral counting techniques attempt to
                 quantify protein abundance by counting the number of detected
                 tryptic peptides and their corresponding MS spectra. However,
                 spectral counting is confounded by the fact that peptide
                 physicochemical properties severely affect MS detection
                 resulting in each peptide having a different detection
                 probability. Lu et al. (2007) described a modified spectral
                 counting technique, Absolute Protein Expression (APEX), which
                 improves on basic spectral counting methods by including a
                 correction factor for each protein (called Oi value) that
                 accounts for variable peptide detection by MS techniques. The
                 technique uses machine learning classification to derive
                 peptide detection probabilities that are used to predict the
                 number of tryptic peptides expected to be detected for one
                 molecule of a particular protein (Oi). This predicted spectral
                 count is compared to the protein's observed MS total spectral
                 count during APEX computation of protein abundances. RESULTS:
                 The APEX Quantitative Proteomics Tool, introduced here, is a
                 free open source Java application that supports the APEX
                 protein quantitation technique. The APEX tool uses data from
                 standard tandem mass spectrometry proteomics experiments and
                 provides computational support for APEX protein abundance
                 quantitation through a set of graphical user interfaces that
                 partition th parameter controls for the various processing
                 tasks. The tool also provides a Z-score analysis for
                 identification of significant differential protein expression,
                 a utility to assess APEX classifier performance via cross
                 validation, and a utility to merge multiple APEX results into
                 a standardized format in preparation for further statistical
                 analysis. CONCLUSION: The APEX Quantitative Proteomics Tool
                 provides a simple means to quickly derive hundreds to
                 thousands of protein abundance values from standard liquid
                 chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics datasets.

                 was converted to exponentially modified PAI (emPAI), equal to
                 10PAI minus one, which is proportional to protein content in a
                 protein mixture. For the 46 proteins in the whole lysate, the
                 deviation percentages of the emPAI-based abundances from the
                 actual values were within 63\% on average, similar or better
                 than determination of abundance by protein staining. emPAI was
                 applied to comprehensive protein expression analysis and to a
                 comparison study between gene and protein expression in a
                 human cancer cell line, HCT116. The values of emPAI are easily
                 calculated and add important quantitation information to
                 proteomic experiments; therefore we suggest that they should
                 be reported in large scale proteomic identification projects.},

  Abstract    = {There is a great interest in reliable ways to obtain absolute
                 protein abundances at a proteome-wide scale. To this end,
                 label-free LC-MS/MS quantification methods have been proposed
                 where all identified proteins are assigned an estimated
                 abundance. Several variants of this quantification approach
                 have been presented, based on either the number of spectral
                 counts per protein or MS1 peak intensities. Equipped with
                 several datasets representing real biological environments,
                 containing a high number of accurately quantified reference
                 proteins, we evaluate five popular low-cost and easily
                 implemented quantification methods (Absolute Protein
                 Expression, Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index,
                 Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification Index, Top3, and
                 MeanInt). Our results demonstrate considerably improved
                 abundance estimates upon implementing accurately quantified
                 reference proteins; that is, using spiked in stable isotope
                 labeled standard peptides or a standard protein mix, to
                 generate a properly calibrated quantification model. We show
                 that only the Top3 method is directly proportional to protein
                 abundance over the full quantification range and is the
                 preferred method in the absence of reference protein
                 measurements. Additionally, we demonstrate that spectral count
                 based quantification methods are associated with higher errors
                 than MS1 peak intensity based methods. Furthermore, we
                 investigate the impact of miscleaved, modified, and shared
                 peptides as well as protein size and the number of employed
                 reference proteins on quantification accuracy.},

  Abstract    = {Relative quantification methods have dominated the
                 quantitative proteomics field. There is a need, however, to
                 conduct absolute quantification studies to accurately model
                 and understand the complex molecular biology that results in
                 proteome variability among biological samples. A new method of
                 absolute quantification of proteins is described. This method
                 is based on the discovery of an unexpected relationship
                 between MS signal response and protein concentration: the
                 average MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic
                 peptides per mole of protein is constant within a coefficient
                 of variation of less than +/-10\%. Given an internal standard,
                 this relationship is used to calculate a universal signal
                 response factor. The universal signal response factor
                 (counts/mol) was shown to be the same for all proteins tested
                 in this study. A controlled set of six exogenous proteins of
                 varying concentrations was studied in the absence and presence
                 of human serum. The absolute quantity of the standard proteins
                 was determined with a relative error of less than +/-15\%. The
                 average MS signal responses of the three most intense peptides
                 from each protein were plotted against their calculated
                 protein concentrations, and this plot resulted in a linear
                 relationship with an R(2) value of 0.9939. The analyses were
                 applied to determine the absolute concentration of 11 common
                 serum proteins, and these concentrations were then compared
                 with known values available in the literature. Additionally
                 within an unfractionated Escherichia coli lysate, a subset of
                 identified proteins known to exist as functional complexes was
                 studied. The calculated absolute quantities were used to
                 accurately determine their stoichiometry.},

                 rapid development over the last few years. Volume and
                 complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar
                 rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the
                 major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are
                 required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist
                 in developing and validating new methods. In order to
                 facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a
                 flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications
                 allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in
                 proteomics. RESULTS: We describe a set of tools for proteomics
                 data analysis-TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP
                 provides a set of computational tools which can be easily
                 combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can
                 be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from
                 useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over
                 wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to
                 completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and
                 data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate
                 rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As
                 such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities
                 of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two
                 example applications: the identification of peptides from a
                 raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis
                 of a standard addition experiment for the absolute
                 quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates

  Abstract    = {Peptide identification using tandem mass spectrometry is a
                 core technology in proteomics. Latest generations of mass
                 spectrometry instruments enable the use of electron transfer
                 dissociation (ETD) to complement collision induced
                 dissociation (CID) for peptide fragmentation. However, a
                 critical limitation to the use of ETD has been optimal
                 database search software. Percolator is a post-search
                 algorithm, which uses semi-supervised machine learning to
                 improve the rate of peptide spectrum identifications (PSMs)
                 together with providing reliable significance measures. We
                 have previously interfaced the Mascot search engine with
                 Percolator and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity
                 benefits with CID data. Here, we report recent developments in
                 the Mascot Percolator V2.0 software including an improved
                 feature calculator and support for a wider range of ion
                 series. The updated software is applied to the analysis of
                 several CID and ETD fragmented peptide data sets. This version
                 of Mascot Percolator increases the number of CID PSMs by up to
                 80\% and ETD PSMs by up to 60\% at a 0.01 q-value (1\% false
                 discovery rate) threshold over a standard Mascot search,
                 notably recovering PSMs from high charge state precursor ions.
                 The greatly increased number of PSMs and peptide coverage
                 afforded by Mascot Percolator has enabled a fuller assessment
                 of CID/ETD complementarity to be performed. Using a data set
                 of CID and ETcaD spectral pairs, we find that at a 1\% false
                 discovery rate, the overlap in peptide identifications by CID

                 so-called database search engines. Frequently, one also runs
                 post-processors such as Percolator to assess the confidence,
                 infer unique peptides, and increase the number of
                 identifications. A recent search engine, MS-GF+, has shown
                 promising results, due to a new and efficient scoring

                 conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database
                 has been developed. In this method the protein database is
                 searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass
                 tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A

  Author      = {Spivak, Marina and Weston, Jason and Bottou, Léon and Käll,

  Abstract    = {Shotgun proteomics coupled with database search software
                 allows the identification of a large number of peptides in a
                 single experiment. However, some existing search algorithms,
                 such as SEQUEST, use score functions that are designed
                 primarily to identify the best peptide for a given spectrum.
                 Consequently, when comparing identifications across spectra,
                 the SEQUEST score function Xcorr fails to discriminate
                 accurately between correct and incorrect peptide
                 identifications. Several machine learning methods have been
                 proposed to address the resulting classification task of
                 distinguishing between correct and incorrect peptide-spectrum
                 matches (PSMs). A recent example is Percolator, which uses
                 semisupervised learning and a decoy database search strategy
                 to learn to distinguish between correct and incorrect PSMs
                 identified by a database search algorithm. The current work
                 describes three improvements to Percolator. (1) Percolator's
                 heuristic optimization is replaced with a clear objective
                 function, with intuitive reasons behind its choice. (2)
                 Tractable nonlinear models are used instead of linear models,
                 leading to improved accuracy over the original Percolator. (3)
                 A method, Q-ranker, for directly optimizing the number of
                 identified spectra at a specified q value is proposed, which
                 achieves further gains.},

  Title    = {On the selection of appropriate distances for gene expression
              data clustering},
  Author   = {Jaskowiak, Pablo A and Campello, Ricardo J G B and Costa, Ivan G},
  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clustering is crucial for gene expression data
              analysis. As an unsupervised exploratory procedure its results
              can help researchers to gain insights and formulate new
              hypothesis about biological data from microarrays. Given
              different settings of microarray experiments, clustering proves
              itself as a versatile exploratory tool. It can help to unveil new
              cancer subtypes or to identify groups of genes that respond
              similarly to a specific experimental condition. In order to
              obtain useful clustering results, however, different parameters
              of the clustering procedure must be properly tuned. Besides the
              selection of the clustering method itself, determining which
              distance is going to be employed between data objects is probably
              one of the most difficult decisions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We
              analyze how different distances and clustering methods interact
              regarding their ability to cluster gene expression, i.e.,
              microarray data. We study 15 distances along with four common
              clustering methods from the literature on a total of 52 gene
              expression microarray datasets. Distances are evaluated on a
              number of different scenarios including clustering of cancer
              tissues and genes from short time-series expression data, the two
              main clustering applications in gene expression. Our results
              support that the selection of an appropriate distance depends on
              the scenario in hand. Moreover, in each scenario, given the very
              same clustering method, significant differences in quality may
              arise from the selection of distinct distance measures. In fact,
              the selection of an appropriate distance measure can make the
              difference between meaningful and poor clustering outcomes, even
              for a suitable clustering method.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: This work describes the first genome-wide analysis
                 of the transcriptional landscape of the pig. A new porcine
                 Affymetrix expression array was designed in order to provide
                 comprehensive coverage of the known pig transcriptome. The new
                 array was used to generate a genome-wide expression atlas of
                 pig tissues derived from 62 tissue/cell types. These data were
                 subjected to network correlation analysis and clustering.
                 RESULTS: The analysis presented here provides a detailed
                 functional clustering of the pig transcriptome where
                 transcripts are grouped according to their expression pattern,
                 so one can infer the function of an uncharacterized gene from
                 the company it keeps and the locations in which it is
                 expressed. We describe the overall transcriptional signatures
                 present in the tissue atlas, where possible assigning those
                 signatures to specific cell populations or pathways. In
                 particular, we discuss the expression signatures associated
                 with the gastrointestinal tract, an organ that was sampled at
                 15 sites along its length and whose biology in the pig is
                 similar to human. We identify sets of genes that define
                 specialized cellular compartments and region-specific
                 digestive functions. Finally, we performed a network analysis
                 of the transcription factors expressed in the gastrointestinal
                 tract and demonstrate how they sub-divide into functional
                 groups that may control cellular gastrointestinal development.
                 CONCLUSIONS: As an important livestock animal with a
                 physiology that is more similar than mouse to man, we provide
                 a major new resource for understanding gene expression with

                 in four dimensions (species, genes, anatomy and developmental

                 time. There are a variety of anatomical gene expression
                 databases, but extracting information from them can be
                 hampered by their diversity and heterogeneity. RESULTS: aGEM
                 3.1 (anatomic Gene Expression Mapping) addresses the issues of
                 diversity and heterogeneity of anatomical gene expression
                 databases by integrating six mouse gene expression resources
                 (EMAGE, GXD, GENSAT, Allen Brain Atlas data base, EUREXPRESS
                 and BioGPS) and three human gene expression databases (HUDSEN,

                 analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues has aided
                 genome annotation and supported functional annotation of
                 mammalian genes. We present a large-scale RNA-Seq dataset
                 representing all the major organ systems from adult sheep and
                 from several juvenile, neonatal and prenatal developmental
                 time points. The Ovis aries reference genome (Oar v3.1)
                 includes 27,504 genes (20,921 protein coding), of which 25,350
                 (19,921 protein coding) had detectable expression in at least
                 one tissue in the sheep gene expression atlas dataset.
                 Network-based cluster analysis of this dataset grouped genes
                 according to their expression pattern. The principle of 'guilt
                 by association' was used to infer the function of
                 uncharacterised genes from their co-expression with genes of
                 known function. We describe the overall transcriptional
                 signatures present in the sheep gene expression atlas and
                 assign those signatures, where possible, to specific cell
                 populations or pathways. The findings are related to innate
                 immunity by focusing on clusters with an immune signature, and
                 to the advantages of cross-breeding by examining the patterns
                 of genes exhibiting the greatest expression differences
                 between purebred and crossbred animals. This high-resolution
                 gene expression atlas for sheep is, to our knowledge, the
                 largest transcriptomic dataset from any livestock species to
                 date. It provides a resource to improve the annotation of the
                 current reference genome for sheep, presenting a model
                 transcriptome for ruminants and insight into gene, cell and
                 tissue function at multiple developmental stages.},

  Author      = {Ringwald, Martin and Wu, Chunlei and Su, Andrew I},
  Abstract    = {Mouse gene expression data are complex and voluminous. To
                 maximize the utility of these data, they must be made readily
                 accessible through databases, and those resources need to
                 place the expression data in the larger biological context.
                 Here we describe two community resources that approach these
                 problems in different but complementary ways: BioGPS and the
                 Mouse Gene Expression Database (GXD). BioGPS connects its
                 large and homogeneous microarray gene expression reference
                 data sets via plugins with a heterogeneous collection of
                 external gene centric resources, thus casting a wide but loose
                 net. GXD acquires different types of expression data from many
                 sources and integrates these data tightly with other types of
                 data in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource, with a
                 strong emphasis on consistency checks and manual curation. We
                 describe and contrast the ``loose'' and ``tight'' data
                 integration strategies employed by BioGPS and GXD,
                 respectively, and discuss the challenges and benefits of data

  Abstract    = {RNA-Seq has proven excellence in providing information about
                 the regulation and transcript levels of genes. We used this
                 method for profiling genes in the flatworm Schistosoma
                 mansoni. This parasite causes schistosomiasis, an infectious
                 disease of global importance for human and animals. The
                 pathology of schistosomiasis is associated with the eggs,
                 which are synthesized as a final consequence of male and
                 female adults pairing. The male induces processes in the
                 female that lead to the full development of its gonads as a
                 prerequisite for egg production. Unpaired females remain
                 sexually immature. Based on an organ-isolation method we
                 obtained gonad tissue for RNA extraction from paired and
                 unpaired schistosomes, with whole adults included as controls.
                 From a total of 23 samples, we used high-throughput cDNA

  Abstract    = {Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is an important grain legume of the

                 link the genome sequence information with agronomic traits
                 resulting from specific developmental processes, a Cajanus
                 cajan gene expression atlas (CcGEA) was developed using the
                 Asha genotype. Thirty tissues/organs representing
                 developmental stages from germination to senescence were used
                 to generate 590.84 million paired-end RNA-Seq data. The CcGEA
                 revealed a compendium of 28 793 genes with differential,
                 specific, spatio-temporal and constitutive expression during
                 various stages of development in different tissues. As an
                 example to demonstrate the application of the CcGEA, a network
                 of 28 flower-related genes analysed for cis-regulatory
                 elements and splicing variants has been identified. In
                 addition, expression analysis of these candidate genes in male
                 sterile and male fertile genotypes suggested their critical
                 role in normal pollen development leading to seed formation.
                 Gene network analysis also identified two regulatory genes, a
                 pollen-specific SF3 and a sucrose-proton symporter, that could
                 have implications for improvement of agronomic traits such as
                 seed production and yield. In conclusion, the CcGEA provides a
                 valuable resource for pigeonpea to identify candidate genes
                 involved in specific developmental processes and to understand
                 the well-orchestrated growth and developmental process in this

  Abstract = {Comprehensive and systematic transcriptome profiling provides
              valuable insight into biological and developmental processes that
              occur throughout the life cycle of a plant. We have enhanced our
              previously published microarray-based gene atlas of maize ( L.)
              inbred B73 to now include 79 distinct replicated samples that
              have been interrogated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The
              current version of the atlas includes 50 original array-based
              gene atlas samples, a time-course of 12 stalk and leaf samples
              postflowering, and an additional set of 17 samples from the maize
              seedling and adult root system. The entire dataset contains 4.6
              billion mapped reads, with an average of 20.5 million mapped
              reads per biological replicate, allowing for detection of genes
              with lower transcript abundance. As the new root samples
              represent key additions to the previously examined tissues, we
              highlight insights into the root transcriptome, which is
              represented by 28,894 (73.2\%) annotated genes in maize.
              Additionally, we observed remarkable expression differences
              across both the longitudinal (four zones) and radial gradients
              (cortical parenchyma and stele) of the primary root supported by
              fourfold differential expression of 9353 and 4728 genes,
              respectively. Among the latter were 1110 genes that encode
              transcription factors, some of which are orthologs of previously
              characterized transcription factors known to regulate root
              development in (L.) Heynh., while most are novel, and represent
              attractive targets for reverse genetics approaches to determine
              their roles in this important organ. This comprehensive

  Abstract    = {Legume research and cultivar development are important for
                 sustainable food production, especially of high-protein seed.
                 Thanks to the development of deep-sequencing technologies,
                 crop species have been taken to the front line, even without
                 completion of their genome sequences. Black-eyed pea (Vigna
                 unguiculata) is a legume species widely grown in semi-arid
                 regions, which has high potential to provide stable seed
                 protein production in a broad range of environments, including
                 drought conditions. The black-eyed pea reference genotype has
                 been used to generate a gene expression atlas of the major
                 plant tissues (i.e. leaf, root, stem, flower, pod and seed),
                 with a developmental time series for pods and seeds. From
                 these various organs, 27 cDNA libraries were generated and
                 sequenced, resulting in more than one billion reads. Following
                 filtering, these reads were de novo assembled into 36 529
                 transcript sequences that were annotated and quantified across
                 the different tissues. A set of 24 866 unique transcript
                 sequences, called Unigenes, was identified. All the
                 information related to transcript identification, annotation
                 and quantification were stored into a gene expression atlas
                 webserver (http://vugea.noble.org), providing a user-friendly
                 interface and necessary tools to analyse transcript expression
                 in black-eyed pea organs and to compare data with other legume
                 species. Using this gene expression atlas, we inferred details
                 of molecular processes that are active during seed
                 development, and identified key putative regulators of seed
                 maturation. Additionally, we found evidence for conservation
                 of regulatory mechanisms involving miRNA in plant tissues

                 commonly originate. However, understanding this critical
                 embryonic phase has relied upon inference from patient
                 phenotypes and assumptions from in vitro stem cell models and
                 non-human vertebrates. We report an integrated transcriptomic

                 tissues and identified unique transcriptional codes which
                 correctly predicted the cause of many congenital disorders. By

  Abstract    = {Over the last decade, the introduction of microarray
                 technology has had a profound impact on gene expression
                 research. The publication of studies with dissimilar or
                 altogether contradictory results, obtained using different
                 microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has
                 raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The
                 MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to
                 address these concerns, as well as other performance and data
                 analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from
                 two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple
                 test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative
                 technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design
                 and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show
                 intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high
                 level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes
                 identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a
                 resource that represents an important first step toward
                 establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in
                 clinical and regulatory settings.},

                 right proteins to be present. Several high-throughput
                 technologies have been used to map out which proteins are
                 expressed in which tissues; however, the data have not
                 previously been systematically compared and integrated. We
                 present a comprehensive evaluation of tissue expression data

                 agree surprisingly well with each other and with results from
                 literature curation and text mining. We further found that

                 distinction between tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression.
                 By developing comparable confidence scores for all types of

  Abstract    = {Human embryogenesis is believed to involve an integrated set
                 of complex yet coordinated development of different organs and
                 tissues mediated by the changes in the spatiotemporal
                 expression of many genes. Here, we report a genome-wide
                 expression analysis during wk 4-9 of human embryogenesis, a
                 critical period when most organs develop. About half of all
                 human genes are expressed, and 18.6\% of the expressed genes
                 were significantly regulated during this important period. We
                 further identified >5000 regulated genes, most of which
                 previously were not known to be associated with animal
                 development. Our study fills an important gap in mammalian
                 developmental studies by identifying functional pathways
                 involved in this critical but previously not studied period.
                 Our study also revealed that the genes involved here are
                 distinct from those during early embryogenesis, which include
                 three groups of maternal genes. Furthermore, we discovered
                 that genes in a given developmental process are regulated
                 coordinately. This led us to develop an easily searchable
                 database of this entire collection of gene expression
                 profiles, allowing for the identification new genes important
                 for a particular developmental process/pathway and deducing
                 the potential function of a novel gene. The validity of the
                 predictions from the database was demonstrated with two
                 examples through spatiotemporal analyses of the two novel
                 genes. Such a database should serve as a highly valuable
                 resource for the molecular analysis of human development and

                 space requires genes associated with specific pathways and
                 functions to be co-ordinately expressed. Here we have combined
                 a large number of publically available microarray datasets
                 derived from human primary cells and analysed large
                 correlation graphs of these data. RESULTS: Using the network
                 analysis tool BioLayout Express3D we identify robust
                 co-associations of genes expressed in a wide variety of cell
                 lineages. We discuss the biological significance of a number
                 of these associations, in particular the coexpression of key
                 transcription factors with the genes that they are likely to
                 control. CONCLUSIONS: We consider the regulation of genes in
                 human primary cells and specifically in the human mononuclear

                 end, we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the
                 expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and

                 sequence data and to correlate functional and genetic brain
                 architecture. Here we describe the generation and analysis of
                 a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising
                 extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray
                 profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in
                 two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously
                 by anatomical location, with different regions and their
                 constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures
                 that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of
                 differential gene expression and gene co-expression
                 relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly
                 reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as
                 neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local
                 neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical
                 subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes
                 and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex
                 displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but
                 with distinct features associated selectively with primary
                 sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe
                 expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis methods exist for combining multiple
                 microarray datasets. However, there are a wide range of issues
                 associated with microarray meta-analysis and a limited ability
                 to compare the performance of different meta-analysis methods.
                 RESULTS: We compare eight meta-analysis methods, five existing
                 methods, two naive methods and a novel approach (mDEDS).
                 Comparisons are performed using simulated data and two
                 biological case studies with varying degrees of meta-analysis
                 complexity. The performance of meta-analysis methods is
                 assessed via ROC curves and prediction accuracy where
                 applicable. CONCLUSIONS: Existing meta-analysis methods vary
                 in their ability to perform successful meta-analysis. This
                 success is very dependent on the complexity of the data and
                 type of analysis. Our proposed method, mDEDS, performs
                 competitively as a meta-analysis tool even as complexity
                 increases. Because of the varying abilities of compared
                 meta-analysis methods, care should be taken when considering

  Abstract    = {Dengue Viruses (DENVs) cause one of the most prevalent
                 arthropod-borne viral diseases affecting millions of people
                 worldwide. Identification of genes involved in DENV
                 pathogenesis would help in deciphering molecular mechanisms
                 responsible for the disease progression. Here, we carried out
                 a meta-analysis of publicly available gene expression data of
                 dengue patients and further validated the meta-profile using
                 in-vitro infection in THP-1 cells. Our findings reveal that
                 DENV infection modulates expression of several genes and
                 signalling pathways including interferons, detoxification of
                 ROS and viral assembly. Interestingly, we have identified
                 novel gene signatures comprising of INADL/PATJ and CRTAP
                 (Cartilage Associated Protein), which were significantly
                 down-regulated across all patient data sets as well as in DENV
                 infected THP-1 cells. PATJ and CRTAP genes are involved in
                 maintaining cell junction integrity and collagen assembly
                 (extracellular matrix component) respectively, which together
                 play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion. Our results
                 categorically reveal that overexpression of CRTAP and PATJ
                 genes restrict DENV infection, thereby suggesting a critical
                 role of these genes in DENV pathogenesis. Conclusively, these
                 findings emphasize the utility of meta-analysis approach in
                 identifying novel gene signatures that might provide
                 mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis and possibly
                 lead towards the development of better therapeutic

                 in making new findings is yet to be unlocked by making them
                 available for large-scale analysis. In order to do so it is
                 essential that independent studies designed for similar
                 biological problems can be integrated, so that new insights
                 can be obtained. These insights would remain undiscovered when
                 analyzing the individual data sets because it is well known
                 that the small number of biological samples used per

               It was shown that even small differences in the numbers of

               outlier-test procedures of Hampel, Grubbs and Graf-Henning, it

               generally resulting in smaller SDs between interlaboratory
               comparisons. The Graf-Henning test detected the fewest outliers
               and its application resulted in the highest SDs of the three

  Abstract = {Outliers are observations that do not follow the statistical
              distribution of the bulk of the data, and consequently may lead
              to erroneous results with respect to statistical analysis. Many
              conventional outlier detection tools are based on the assumption
              that the data is identically and independently distributed. In
              this paper, an outlier-resistant data filter-cleaner is proposed.
              The proposed data filter-cleaner includes an on-line
              outlier-resistant estimate of the process model and combines it
              with a modified Kalman filter to detect and ``clean'' outliers.
              The advantage over existing methods is that the proposed method
              has the following features: (a) a priori knowledge of the process
              model is not required; (b) it is applicable to autocorrelated
              data; (c) it can be implemented on-line; and (d) it tries to only

  Abstract  = {A common procedure in testing analytical methods is to send a
               portion of each of a number of samples to each of several
               laboratories. The results of such a study are submitted to
               statistical analysis to determine the two important variance
               components in the problem: replication error and laboratory
               bias. Outliers are relatively common in these data both among
               laboratory effects and among the residuals. This paper presents
               a method of analysis for interlaboratory studies that is robust
               to the existence of outliers and long-tailed distributions of
               random effects. Theoretical considerations as well as a Monte
               Carlo study are adduced as support for this new technique.},

               used their in-house method with 44 laboratories applying head
               space GC ECD analysis and 5 using liquid/liquid extraction. A
               set of two artificially produced samples was prepared; the
               halogenated hydrocarbons investigated were trichloroethylene,
               tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloromethane,
               tetrachloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, dichloromethane,
               dibromochloromethane, bromodichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane
               and tribromomethane. The procedure of sample preparation,
               storage and distribution was monitored by an extensive quality
               assurance system including homogeneity tests, stability tests,
               and trend analysis of the submitted data. The analytical results
               submitted by the participants exhibited RSD values of up to 35\%
               and outlier rates of up to 19\%. The percentage of false
               positive and false negative results was at the highest 12\% for
               selected substances. Recovery rates varying from 86\% to 106\%

    Abstract = {Driven by the recent advances of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and an urgent need to decode complex human diseases, a multitude of large-scale studies were conducted recently that have resulted in an unprecedented volume of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data. While these data offer new opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying disease, the comparison of data from different sources poses a great challenge, due to differences in sample and data processing. Here, we present a pipeline that processes and unifies RNA-seq data from different studies, which includes uniform realignment and gene expression quantification as well as batch effect removal. We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison. We have processed data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and have successfully corrected for study-specific biases, enabling comparative analysis across studies.

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Differences in gene expression drive phenotypic
                 differences between species, yet major organs and tissues
                 generally have conserved gene expression programs. Several
                 comparative transcriptomic studies have observed greater
                 similarity in gene expression between homologous tissues from
                 different vertebrate species than between diverse tissues of
                 the same species. However, a recent study by Lin and
                 colleagues reached the opposite conclusion. These studies
                 differed in the species and tissues analyzed, and in technical
                 details of library preparation, sequencing, read mapping,
                 normalization, gene sets, and clustering methods. RESULTS: To
                 better understand gene expression evolution we reanalyzed data
                 from four studies, including that of Lin, encompassing 6-13
                 tissues each from 11 vertebrate species using standardized
                 mapping, normalization, and clustering methods. An analysis of
                 independent data showed that the set of tissues chosen by Lin
                 et al. were more similar to each other than those analyzed by
                 previous studies. Comparing expression in five common tissues
                 from the four studies, we observed that samples clustered
                 exclusively by tissue rather than by species or study,
                 supporting conservation of organ physiology in mammals.
                 Furthermore, inter-study distances between homologous tissues
                 were generally less than intra-study distances among different
                 tissues, enabling informative meta-analyses. Notably, when
                 comparing expression divergence of tissues over time to
                 expression variation across 51 human GTEx tissues, we could
                 accurately predict the clustering of expression for arbitrary
                 pairs of tissues and species. CONCLUSIONS: These results
                 provide a framework for the design of future evolutionary
                 studies of gene expression and demonstrate the utility of
                 comparing RNA-seq data across studies.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing is now regularly used
                 for studies of the transcriptome (RNA-seq), particularly for
                 comparisons among experimental conditions. For the time being,
                 a limited number of biological replicates are typically
                 considered in such experiments, leading to low detection power
                 for differential expression. As their cost continues to
                 decrease, it is likely that additional follow-up studies will
                 be conducted to re-address the same biological question.
                 RESULTS: We demonstrate how p-value combination techniques
                 previously used for microarray meta-analyses can be used for
                 the differential analysis of RNA-seq data from multiple
                 related studies. These techniques are compared to a negative
                 binomial generalized linear model (GLM) including a fixed
                 study effect on simulated data and real data on human melanoma
                 cell lines. The GLM with fixed study effect performed well for
                 low inter-study variation and small numbers of studies, but
                 was outperformed by the meta-analysis methods for moderate to
                 large inter-study variability and larger numbers of studies.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The p-value combination techniques illustrated
                 here are a valuable tool to perform differential meta-analyses
                 of RNA-seq data by appropriately accounting for biological and
                 technical variability within studies as well as additional

  Abstract = {Sequencing-based gene expression methods like RNA-sequencing
              (RNA-seq) have become increasingly common, but it is often
              claimed that results obtained in different studies are not
              comparable owing to the influence of laboratory batch effects,
              differences in RNA extraction and sequencing library preparation
              methods and bioinformatics processing pipelines. It would be
              unfortunate if different experiments were in fact incomparable,
              as there is great promise in data fusion and meta-analysis
              applied to sequencing data sets. We therefore compared reported
              gene expression measurements for ostensibly similar samples
              (specifically, human brain, heart and kidney samples) in several
              different RNA-seq studies to assess their overall consistency and
              to examine the factors contributing most to systematic
              differences. The same comparisons were also performed after
              preprocessing all data in a consistent way, eliminating potential
              bias from bioinformatics pipelines. We conclude that published
              human tissue RNA-seq expression measurements appear relatively
              consistent in the sense that samples cluster by tissue rather
              than laboratory of origin given simple preprocessing
              transformations. The article is supplemented by a detailed

  Abstract  = {One major task in molecular biology is to understand the

               Pearson's correlation is the most common method used to measure
               dependence between gene expression signals, but it works well
               only when data are linearly associated. For other types of
               association, such as non-linear or non-functional relationships,
               methods based on the concepts of rank correlation and
               information theory-based measures are more adequate than the
               Pearson's correlation, but are less used in applications, most
               probably because of a lack of clear guidelines for their use.
               This work seeks to summarize the main methods (Pearson's,
               Spearman's and Kendall's correlations; distance correlation;
               Hoeffding's D measure; Heller–Heller–Gorfine measure; mutual

               expression data, and also to evaluate the strengths and
               limitations of each method. Systematic Monte Carlo simulation
               analyses ranging from sample size, local dependence and
               linear/non-linear and also non-functional relationships are
               shown. Moreover, comparisons in actual gene expression data are

  Abstract    = {Understanding the normal state of human tissue transcriptome
                 profiles is essential for recognizing tissue disease states
                 and identifying disease markers. Recently, the Human Protein
                 Atlas and the FANTOM5 consortium have each published extensive
                 transcriptome data for human samples using Illumina-sequenced
                 RNA-Seq and Heliscope-sequenced CAGE. Here, we report on the
                 first large-scale complex tissue transcriptome comparison
                 between full-length versus 5'-capped mRNA sequencing data.
                 Overall gene expression correlation was high between the 22
                 corresponding tissues analyzed (R > 0.8). For genes
                 ubiquitously expressed across all tissues, the two data sets
                 showed high genome-wide correlation (91\% agreement), with
                 differences observed for a small number of individual genes
                 indicating the need to update their gene models. Among the
                 identified single-tissue enriched genes, up to 75\% showed
                 consensus of 7-fold enrichment in the same tissue in both
                 methods, while another 17\% exhibited multiple tissue
                 enrichment and/or high expression variety in the other data
                 set, likely dependent on the cell type proportions included in

  Abstract    = {One of the major properties of genes is their expression
                 pattern. Notably, genes are often classified as tissue
                 specific or housekeeping. This property is of interest to
                 molecular evolution as an explanatory factor of, e.g.
                 evolutionary rate, as well as a functional feature which may
                 in itself evolve. While many different methods of measuring
                 tissue specificity have been proposed and used for such
                 studies, there has been no comparison or benchmarking of these
                 methods to our knowledge, and little justification of their
                 use. In this study, we compare nine measures of tissue
                 specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and
                 microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq. We
                 analyse their capacity to distinguish gene categories, their
                 robustness to the choice and number of tissues used and their

                 collected and curated 2461 tissue specific genes (TissGenes)

                 prognostic marker-based analyses across 28 cancer types using

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The RNA-seq technique is applied for the
                 investigation of transcriptional behaviour. The reduction in
                 sequencing costs has led to an unprecedented trove of gene
                 expression data from diverse biological systems. Subsequently,
                 principles from other disciplines such as the Benford law,
                 which can be properly judged only in data-rich systems, can
                 now be examined on this high-throughput transcriptomic
                 information. The Benford law, states that in many count-rich
                 datasets the distribution of the first significant digit is
                 not uniform but rather logarithmic. RESULTS: All tested
                 digital gene expression datasets showed a Benford-like
                 distribution when observing an entire gene set. This
                 phenomenon was conserved in development and does not
                 demonstrate tissue specificity. However, when obedience to the
                 Benford law is calculated for individual expressed genes
                 across thousands of cells, genes that best and least adhere to
                 the Benford law are enriched with tissue specific or cell
                 maintenance descriptors, respectively. Surprisingly, a
                 positive correlation was found between the obedience a gene
                 exhibits to the Benford law and its expression level, despite
                 the former being calculated solely according to first digit
                 frequency while totally ignoring the expression value itself.
                 Nevertheless, genes with low expression that exhibit Benford
                 behavior demonstrate tissue specific associations. These
                 observations were extended to predict the likelihood of tissue
                 specificity based on Benford behaviour in a supervised
                 learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the
                 applicability and potential predictability of the Benford law
                 for gleaning biological insight from simple count data.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Understanding how genes are expressed and
                 regulated in different tissues is a fundamental and
                 challenging question. However, most of currently available
                 biological databases do not focus on tissue-specific gene
                 regulation. RESULTS: The recent development of computational
                 methods for tissue-specific combinational gene regulation,
                 based on transcription factor binding sites, enables us to
                 perform a large-scale analysis of tissue-specific gene
                 regulation in human tissues. The results are stored in a web
                 database called TiGER (Tissue-specific Gene Expression and
                 Regulation). The database contains three types of data
                 including tissue-specific gene expression profiles,
                 combinatorial gene regulations, and cis-regulatory module

                 for 7,341 transcription factor pairs and 6,232 putative CRMs
                 for 2,130 RefSeq genes. CONCLUSION: We have developed and made

                 provides large scale data sets for tissue-specific gene

              and functionally characterized a consensus lncRNA transcriptome
              by curating hundreds of RNA-seq datasets across normal human
              tissues from 16 independent studies. In total, 1,184 UE and 2,583
              TS lncRNAs were identified. These different lncRNA populations
              had several distinct features. Specifically, UE lncRNAs were
              associated with genomic compaction and highly conserved exons and
              promoter regions. We found that UE lncRNAs are regulated at the
              transcriptional level (with especially strong regulation of
              enhancers) and are associated with epigenetic modifications and
              post-transcriptional regulation. Based on these observations we
              propose a novel way to predict the functions of UE and TS lncRNAs

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the important goals of microarray research is
              the identification of genes whose expression is considerably
              higher or lower in some tissues than in others. We would like to
              have ways of identifying such tissue-specific genes. RESULTS: We
              describe a method, ROKU, which selects tissue-specific patterns
              from gene expression data for many tissues and thousands of
              genes. ROKU ranks genes according to their overall tissue
              specificity using Shannon entropy and detects tissues specific to
              each gene if any exist using an outlier detection method. We
              evaluated the capacity for the detection of various specific
              expression patterns using synthetic and real data. We observed
              that ROKU was superior to a conventional entropy-based method in
              its ability to rank genes according to overall tissue specificity
              and to detect genes whose expression pattern are specific only to
              objective tissues. CONCLUSION: ROKU is useful for the detection
              of various tissue-specific expression patterns. The framework is
              also directly applicable to the selection of diagnostic markers

  Abstract = {Tissue-specific gene expression is generally regulated by more
              than a single transcription factor (TF). Multiple TFs work in
              concert to achieve tissue specificity. In order to explore these
              complex TF interaction networks, we performed a large-scale
              analysis of TF interactions for 30 human tissues. We first
              identified tissue-specific genes for 30 tissues based on gene
              expression databases. We then evaluated the relationships between
              TFs using the relative position and co-occurrence of their
              binding sites in the promoters of tissue-specific genes. The
              predicted TF-TF interactions were validated by both known
              protein-protein interactions and co-expression of their target

              the highest co-expression in the tissue of interest. Our findings
              demonstrate that non-tissue specific TFs play a large role in
              regulation of tissue-specific genes. Furthermore, they show that
              individual TFs can contribute to tissue specificity in different

               characteristics of transcripts in different human tissues, we
               deeply sequenced RNA samples from 14 different human tissues.
               After filtering many lowly expressed transcripts, 24,729
               protein-coding transcripts and 1,653 noncoding transcripts were
               identified. By analyzing highly expressed tissue-specific
               protein-coding transcripts (TSCTs) and noncoding transcripts
               (TSNTs), we found that testis expressed the highest numbers of
               TSCTs and TSNTs. Brain, monocytes, ovary, and heart expressed
               more TSCTs than the rest tissues, whereas brain, placenta,
               heart, and monocytes expressed more TSNTs than other tissues.
               Co-expression network constructed based on the TSCTs and TSNTs
               showed that each hub TSNT was co-expressed with several TSCTs,

  Title    = {Defining diversity, specialization, and gene specificity in
              transcriptomes through information theory},
  Author   = {Martínez, Octavio and Reyes-Valdés, M Humberto},
  Abstract = {The transcriptome is a set of genes transcribed in a given tissue
              under specific conditions and can be characterized by a list of
              genes with their corresponding frequencies of transcription.
              Transcriptome changes can be measured by counting gene tags from
              mRNA libraries or by measuring light signals in DNA microarrays.
              In any case, it is difficult to completely comprehend the global
              changes that occur in the transcriptome, given that thousands of
              gene expression measurements are involved. We propose an approach
              to define and estimate the diversity and specialization of
              transcriptomes and gene specificity. We define transcriptome
              diversity as the Shannon entropy of its frequency distribution.
              Gene specificity is defined as the mutual information between the
              tissues and the corresponding transcript, allowing detection of
              either housekeeping or highly specific genes and clarifying the
              meaning of these concepts in the literature. Tissue
              specialization is measured by average gene specificity. We
              introduce the formulae using a simple example and show their
              application in two datasets of gene expression in human tissues.
              Visualization of the positions of transcriptomes in a system of
              diversity and specialization coordinates makes it possible to
              understand at a glance their interrelations, summarizing in a
              powerful way which transcriptomes are richer in diversity of
              expressed genes, or which are relatively more specialized. The
              framework presented enlightens the relation among transcriptomes,
              allowing a better understanding of their changes through the
              development of the organism or in response to environmental

  Author   = {Soneson, Charlotte and Delorenzi, Mauro},
  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed
              between conditions is an integral part of understanding the
              molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA
              microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance
              of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently
              high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a
              powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is
              conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression
              analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and
              address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data,
              a number of software packages have been developed especially for
              differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. RESULTS: We
              conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for
              differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are
              freely available within the R framework and take as input a
              matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each
              genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We
              evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real
              RNA-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are
              still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all
              evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions
              should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the
              methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the
              'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well
              under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq

              main source of variation between different MAGE datasets is due
              to the so-called 'batch effects'. The methods reviewed here
              perform data integration by removing (or more precisely

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput molecular profiling data has been
              used to improve clinical decision making by stratifying subjects
              based on their molecular profiles. Unsupervised clustering
              algorithms can be used for stratification purposes. However, the
              current speed of the clustering algorithms cannot meet the
              requirement of large-scale molecular data due to poor performance
              of the correlation matrix calculation. With high-throughput
              sequencing technologies promising to produce even larger datasets
              per subject, we expect the performance of the state-of-the-art
              statistical algorithms to be further impacted unless efforts
              towards optimisation are carried out. MapReduce is a widely used
              high performance parallel framework that can solve the problem.
              RESULTS: In this paper, we evaluate the current parallel modes
              for correlation calculation methods and introduce an efficient
              data distribution and parallel calculation algorithm based on
              MapReduce to optimise the correlation calculation. We studied the
              performance of our algorithm using two gene expression
              benchmarks. In the micro-benchmark, our implementation using
              MapReduce, based on the R package RHIPE, demonstrates a 3.26-5.83
              fold increase compared to the default Snowfall and 1.56-1.64 fold
              increase compared to the basic RHIPE in the Euclidean, Pearson
              and Spearman correlations. Though vanilla R and the optimised
              Snowfall outperforms our optimised RHIPE in the micro-benchmark,
              they do not scale well with the macro-benchmark. In the
              macro-benchmark the optimised RHIPE performs 2.03-16.56 times
              faster than vanilla R. Benefiting from the 3.30-5.13 times faster
              data preparation, the optimised RHIPE performs 1.22-1.71 times
              faster than the optimised Snowfall. Both the optimised RHIPE and
              the optimised Snowfall successfully performs the Kendall
              correlation with TCGA dataset within 7 hours. Both of them
              conduct more than 30 times faster than the estimated vanilla R.
              CONCLUSIONS: The performance evaluation found that the new
              MapReduce algorithm and its implementation in RHIPE outperforms
              vanilla R and the conventional parallel algorithms implemented in
              R Snowfall. We propose that MapReduce framework holds great
              promise for large molecular data analysis, in particular for
              high-dimensional genomic data such as that demonstrated in the
              performance evaluation described in this paper. We aim to use
              this new algorithm as a basis for optimising high-throughput
              molecular data correlation calculation for Big Data.},

@article{Khang2015-qt,
  Title    = {Getting the most out of {RNA-seq} data analysis},
  Author   = {Khang, Tsung Fei and Lau, Ching Yee},
  Abstract = {Background. A common research goal in transcriptome projects is
              to find genes that are differentially expressed in different
              phenotype classes. Biologists might wish to validate such gene
              candidates experimentally, or use them for downstream systems
              biology analysis. Producing a coherent differential gene
              expression analysis from RNA-seq count data requires an
              understanding of how numerous sources of variation such as the
              replicate size, the hypothesized biological effect size, and the
              specific method for making differential expression calls
              interact. We believe an explicit demonstration of such
              interactions in real RNA-seq data sets is of practical interest
              to biologists. Results. Using two large public RNA-seq data
              sets-one representing strong, and another mild, biological effect
              size-we simulated different replicate size scenarios, and tested
              the performance of several commonly-used methods for calling
              differentially expressed genes in each of them. We found that,
              when biological effect size was mild, RNA-seq experiments should
              focus on experimental validation of differentially expressed gene
              candidates. Importantly, at least triplicates must be used, and
              the differentially expressed genes should be called using methods
              with high positive predictive value (PPV), such as NOISeq or
              GFOLD. In contrast, when biological effect size was strong,
              differentially expressed genes mined from unreplicated
              experiments using NOISeq, ASC and GFOLD had between 30 to 50\%
              mean PPV, an increase of more than 30-fold compared to the cases
              of mild biological effect size. Among methods with good PPV
              performance, having triplicates or more substantially improved
              mean PPV to over 90\% for GFOLD, 60\% for DESeq2, 50\% for
              NOISeq, and 30\% for edgeR. At a replicate size of six, we found
              DESeq2 and edgeR to be reasonable methods for calling
              differentially expressed genes at systems level analysis, as
              their PPV and sensitivity trade-off were superior to the other
              methods'. Conclusion. When biological effect size is weak,
              systems level investigation is not possible using RNAseq data,
              and no meaningful result can be obtained in unreplicated
              experiments. Nonetheless, NOISeq or GFOLD may yield limited
              numbers of gene candidates with good validation potential, when
              triplicates or more are available. When biological effect size is
              strong, NOISeq and GFOLD are effective tools for detecting
              differentially expressed genes in unreplicated RNA-seq
              experiments for qPCR validation. When triplicates or more are
              available, GFOLD is a sharp tool for identifying high confidence
              differentially expressed genes for targeted qPCR validation; for
              downstream systems level analysis, combined results from DESeq2
              and edgeR are useful.},

  Abstract  = {Physiological and molecular similarities between organisms make
               it possible to translate findings from simpler experimental
               systems—model organisms—into more complex ones, such as human.
               This translation facilitates the understanding of biological
               processes under normal or disease conditions. Researchers aiming
               to identify the similarities and differences between organisms
               at the molecular level need resources collecting multi-organism
               tissue expression data. We have developed a database of
               gene–tissue associations in human, mouse, rat and pig by
               integrating multiple sources of evidence: transcriptomics
               covering all four species and proteomics (human only), manually
               curated and mined from the scientific literature. Through a
               scoring scheme, these associations are made comparable across
               all sources of evidence and across organisms. Furthermore, the
               scoring produces a confidence score assigned to each of the
               associations. The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly
               accessible through a user-friendly web interface and as part of
               the STRING app for Cytoscape. In addition, we analyzed the
               agreement between datasets, across and within organisms, and
               identified that the agreement is mainly affected by the quality
               of the datasets rather than by the technologies used or
               organisms compared.Database URL: http://tissues.jensenlab.org/},

  Title    = {Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using
              empirical Bayes methods},
  Author   = {Johnson, W Evan and Li, Cheng and Rabinovic, Ariel},
  Abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that
              our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in
              practice. Software for our method is freely available at:

  Abstract = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental
              pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types
              that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we
              mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human
              and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a
              comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the
              human body. We find that few genes are truly 'housekeeping',
              whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed
              of several closely separated TSSs, with independent
              cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to
              different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters
              of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based
              expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining
              cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions
              of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression
              and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional
              annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides
              comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of

              remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein
              levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the
              factors determining the variability between the abundances of
              different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the

              We grouped the samples according to tissue types, and in each of
              the groups, we identified genes that are stably expressed across
              biological samples, treatment conditions, and experiments. We fit
              a Poisson log-linear mixed-effect model to the read counts for
              each gene and decomposed the total variance into between-sample,
              between-treatment and between-experiment variance components.
              Identifying stably expressed genes is useful for count
              normalization and differential expression analysis. The variance

              simplified terms, that DNA makes RNA makes proteins, but there is
              considerable uncertainty regarding the general, genome-wide
              correlation between levels of RNA and corresponding proteins.
              Therefore, to assess degrees of this correlation we compared the
              RNA profiles (determined using both cDNA- and oligo-based
              microarrays) and protein profiles (determined
              immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays) of 1066 gene
              products in 23 human cell lines. RESULTS: A high mean correlation
              coefficient (0.52) was obtained from the pairwise comparison of
              RNA levels determined by the two platforms. Significant
              correlations, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.445,
              between protein and RNA levels were also obtained for a third of
              the specific gene products. However, the correlation coefficients
              between levels of RNA and protein products of specific genes
              varied widely, and the mean correlations between the protein and
              corresponding RNA levels determined using the cDNA- and
              oligo-based microarrays were 0.25 and 0.20, respectively.
              CONCLUSION: Significant correlations were found in one third of
              the examined RNA species and corresponding proteins. These
              results suggest that RNA profiling might provide indirect support
              to antibodies' specificity, since whenever a evident correlation
              between the RNA and protein profiles exists, this can sustain
              that the antibodies used in the immunoassay recognized their

              polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific polypeptides were
              identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
              spectrometry. For the same 85 samples, mRNA levels were
              determined using oligonucleotide microarrays, allowing a
              comparative analysis of mRNA and protein expression among the 165
              protein spots. Twenty-eight of the 165 protein spots (17\%) or 21
              of 98 genes (21.4\%) had a statistically significant correlation
              between protein and mRNA expression (r > 0.2445; p < 0.05);
              however, among all 165 proteins the correlation coefficient
              values (r) ranged from -0.467 to 0.442. Correlation coefficient
              values were not related to protein abundance. Further, no
              significant correlation between mRNA and protein expression was
              found (r = -0.025) if the average levels of mRNA or protein among
              all samples were applied across the 165 protein spots (98 genes).
              The mRNA/protein correlation coefficient also varied among
              proteins with multiple isoforms, indicating potentially separate
              isoform-specific mechanisms for the regulation of protein
              abundance. Among the 21 genes with a significant correlation
              between mRNA and protein, five genes differed significantly
              between stage I and stage III lung adenocarcinomas. Using a
              quantitative analysis of mRNA and protein expression within the
              same lung adenocarcinomas, we showed that only a subset of the
              proteins exhibited a significant correlation with mRNA abundance.",

               comprehensively in mammals, although previous work in plants and
               yeast suggest a surprisingly modest correlation. We have
               examined this issue using a genetic approach in which natural
               variations were used to perturb both transcript levels and
               protein levels among inbred strains of mice. We quantified over
               5,000 peptides and over 22,000 transcripts in livers of 97
               inbred and recombinant inbred strains and focused on the 7,185
               most heritable transcripts and 486 most reliable proteins. The
               transcript levels were quantified by microarray analysis in
               three replicates and the proteins were quantified by Liquid
               Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry using O(18)-reference-based
               isotope labeling approach. We show that the levels of
               transcripts and proteins correlate significantly for only about
               half of the genes tested, with an average correlation of 0.27,
               and the correlations of transcripts and proteins varied
               depending on the cellular location and biological function of
               the gene. We examined technical and biological factors that
               could contribute to the modest correlation. For example,
               differential splicing clearly affects the analyses for certain
               genes; but, based on deep sequencing, this does not
               substantially contribute to the overall estimate of the
               correlation. We also employed genome-wide association analyses
               to map loci controlling both transcript and protein levels.
               Surprisingly, little overlap was observed between the protein-
               and transcript-mapped loci. We have typed numerous clinically
               relevant traits among the strains, including adiposity,
               lipoprotein levels, and tissue parameters. Using correlation
               analysis, we found that a low number of clinical trait
               relationships are preserved between the protein and mRNA gene
               products and that the majority of such relationships are
               specific to either the protein levels or transcript levels.
               Surprisingly, transcript levels were more strongly correlated
               with clinical traits than protein levels. In light of the

              biofilm time points that was consistently higher or consistently
              lower than that seen across the majority of planktonic time
              points. However, there was little overlap between the genes and

              regulation of protein expression by nontranscriptional
              mechanisms. This report illustrates the benefits and weaknesses
              of two different approaches to global expression profiling, and
              it also demonstrates the advantage of using proteomics in

              of global expression within biofilms. In addition, this report
              provides the fullest characterization of expression patterns in
              GAS biofilms currently available.IMPORTANCEProkaryotes are
              thought to regulate their proteomes largely at the level of
              transcription. However, the results from this first set of global
              transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of paired microbial samples
              presented here show that this assumption is false for the
              majority of genes and their products inS. pyogenes. In addition,
              the tenuousness of the link between transcription and translation
              becomes even more pronounced when microbes exist in a biofilm or
              a stationary planktonic state. Since the transcriptome level does
              not usually equal the proteome level, the validity attributed to
              gene expression studies as well as proteomic studies in microbial
              analyses must be brought into question. Therefore, the results
              attained by either approach, whether RNA-seq or shotgun
              proteomics, must be taken in context and evaluated with
              particular care since they are by no means interchangeable.",

              years. With the use of deep sequencing of RNA samples (RNA-seq)
              and mass spectrometry technology for protein identification and
              quantitation, it is now feasible to compare gene and protein
              expression on a massive scale and for any organism for which
              genomic data is available. Although these technologies are
              currently applied to many research questions in various model
              systems ranging from cell cultures to the entire organism level,
              there are few comparative studies of these technologies in the
              same system, let alone on the same samples. Here we present a
              comparison between gene and protein expression in embryos of
              zebrafish, which is an upcoming model in disease studies.
              RESULTS: We compared Agilent custom made expression microarrays
              with Illumina deep sequencing for RNA analysis, showing as
              expected a high degree of correlation of expression of a common
              set of 18,230 genes. Gene expression was also found to correlate
              with the abundance of 963 distinct proteins, with several
              categories of genes as exceptions. These exceptions include
              ribosomal proteins, histones and vitellogenins, for which
              biological and technical explanations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS:
              By comparing state of the art transcriptomic and proteomic
              technologies on samples derived from the same group of organisms
              we have for the first time benchmarked the differences in these
              technologies with regard to sensitivity and bias towards
              detection of particular gene categories in zebrafish. Our
              datasets submitted to public repositories are a good starting
              point for researchers interested in disease progression in

              reliable characterization of complex protein mixtures, but
              suffers from low sensitivity in protein identification. In a
              typical shotgun proteomics experiment, it is assumed that all
              proteins are equally likely to be present. However, there is
              often other information available, e.g. the probability of a
              protein's presence is likely to correlate with its mRNA
              concentration. RESULTS: We develop a Bayesian score that
              estimates the posterior probability of a protein's presence in
              the sample given its identification in an MS/MS experiment and
              its mRNA concentration measured under similar experimental
              conditions. Our method, MSpresso, substantially increases the
              number of proteins identified in an MS/MS experiment at the same
              error rate, e.g. in yeast, MSpresso increases the number of
              proteins identified by approximately 40\%. We apply MSpresso to
              data from different MS/MS instruments, experimental conditions
              and organisms (Escherichia coli, human), and predict 19-63\% more

              that incorporating prior knowledge of protein presence into

  author   = "Li, Jingyi Jessica and Bickel, Peter J and Biggin, Mark D",
  abstract = "Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest
              that the protein expressed at the median abundance is present at
              8,000-16,000 molecules per cell and that differences in mRNA
              expression between genes explain only 10-40\% of the differences
              in protein levels. We find, however, that these surveys have
              significantly underestimated protein abundances and the relative
              importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61
              housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data from
              Schwanhausser et al. (2011), we find that the median protein
              detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per cell and that our
              corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher correlation
              with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. In
              addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and
              protein abundances using direct experimental measurements of
              these errors. The resulting analysis suggests that mRNA levels
              explain at least 56\% of the differences in protein abundance for
              the 4,212 genes detected by Schwanhausser et al. (2011), though
              because one major source of error could not be estimated the true
              percent contribution should be higher. We also employed a second,
              independent strategy to determine the contribution of mRNA levels
              to protein expression. We show that the variance in translation
              rates directly measured by ribosome profiling is only 12\% of
              that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. (2011), and that the
              measured and inferred translation rates correlate poorly (R(2) =
              0.13). Based on this, our second strategy suggests that mRNA
              levels explain ∼81\% of the variance in protein levels. We also
              determined the percent contributions of transcription, RNA
              degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance
              in protein abundances using both of our strategies. While the
              magnitudes of the two estimates vary, they both suggest that
              transcription plays a more important role than the earlier
              studies implied and translation a much smaller role. Finally, the
              above estimates only apply to those genes whose mRNA and protein
              expression was detected. Based on a detailed analysis by
              Hebenstreit et al. (2012), we estimate that approximately 40\% of
              genes in a given cell within a population express no mRNA. Since
              there can be no translation in the absence of mRNA, we argue that
              differences in translation rates can play no role in determining
              the expression levels for the ∼40\% of genes that are
              non-expressed.",

              amino-acid properties, upstream open reading frames and secondary

              as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of
              statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of
              noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure
              biological variability and to obtain correct statistical
              inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We
              introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these
              artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only
              affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with
              principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the

              subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses.

              technical variations that affect the measurements in
              high-throughput studies such as RNA sequencing. It has been well
              established that batch effects can be caused by different
              experimental platforms, laboratory conditions, different sources
              of samples and personnel differences. These differences can
              confound the outcomes of interest and lead to spurious results. A
              critical input for batch correction algorithms is the knowledge
              of batch factors, which in many cases are unknown or inaccurate.
              Hence, the primary motivation of our paper is to detect hidden
              batch factors that can be used in standard techniques to
              accurately capture the relationship between gene expression and
              other modeled variables of interest. Results: We introduce a new
              algorithm based on data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-Non-negative
              Matrix Factorization for the detection of unknown batch effects.
              We test our algorithm on three different datasets: (i) Sequencing
              Quality Control, (ii) Topotecan RNA-Seq and (iii) Single-cell RNA
              sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on Glioblastoma Multiforme. We have
              demonstrated a superior performance in identifying hidden batch
              effects as compared to existing algorithms for batch detection in
              all three datasets. In the Topotecan study, we were able to
              identify a new batch factor that has been missed by the original
              study, leading to under-representation of differentially
              expressed genes. For scRNA-Seq, we demonstrated the power of our

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: For functional genomics studies, it is important to
              understand the dynamic expression profiles of transcribed genes
              in different tissues, stages of development and in response to
              environmental stimuli. The proliferation in the use of
              next-generation sequencing technologies by the plant research
              community has led to the accumulation of large volumes of
              expression data. However, analysis of these datasets is
              complicated by the frequent occurrence of polyploidy among
              economically-important crop species. In addition, processing and
              analyzing such large volumes of sequence data is a technical and
              time-consuming task, limiting their application in functional
              genomics studies, particularly for smaller laboratories which
              lack access to high-powered computing infrastructure. Wheat is a
              good example of a young polyploid species with three similar
              genomes (97 \% identical among homoeologous genes), rapidly
              accumulating RNA-seq datasets and a large research community.
              DESCRIPTION: We present WheatExp, an expression database and
              visualization tool to analyze and compare homoeologue-specific
              transcript profiles across a broad range of tissues from
              different developmental stages in polyploid wheat. Beginning with
              publicly-available RNA-seq datasets, we developed a pipeline to
              distinguish between homoeologous transcripts from annotated genes
              in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. Data from multiple studies is
              processed and compiled into a database which can be queried
              either by BLAST or by searching for a known gene of interest by
              name or functional domain. Expression data of multiple genes can
              be displayed side-by-side across all expression datasets
              providing immediate access to a comprehensive panel of expression
              data for specific subsets of wheat genes. CONCLUSIONS: The
              development of a publicly accessible expression database hosted
              on the GrainGenes website - http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/WheatExp/ -
              coupled with a simple and readily-comparable visualization tool
              will empower the wheat research community to use RNA-seq data and
              to perform functional analyses of target genes. The presented
              expression data is homoeologue-specific allowing for the analysis
              of relative contributions from each genome to the overall
              expression of a gene, a critical consideration for breeding
              applications. Our approach can be expanded to other polyploid
              species by adjusting sequence mapping parameters according to the
              specific divergence of their genomes.",

              species, which we found to be enriched for genes involved in

              splicing is tightly regulated within and between species,
              sex-specific and lineage-specific changes in the expression of
              different splice forms are also frequent. Intriguingly, among
              genes in which a change in exon usage occurred exclusively in the
              human lineage, we found an enrichment of genes involved in
              anatomical structure and morphogenesis, raising the possibility
              that differences in the regulation of alternative splicing have
              been an important force in human evolution.",

              complications and premature death, yet the underlying molecular
              mechanisms are largely unknown. Pancreatic islet dysfunction is
              central in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, and understanding islet
              genome regulation could therefore provide valuable mechanistic
              insights. We have now mapped and examined the function of human
              islet cis-regulatory networks. We identify genomic sequences that
              are targeted by islet transcription factors to drive
              islet-specific gene activity and show that most such sequences
              reside in clusters of enhancers that form physical
              three-dimensional chromatin domains. We find that sequence
              variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glycemia are
              enriched in these clustered islet enhancers and identify
              trait-associated variants that disrupt DNA binding and islet

              pipeline that can identify fusion transcripts and assess their
              redundancy and tumor subtype-specific distribution in primary
              tumors. In a study of primary breast tumors, SnowShoes-FTD was
              used to analyze paired-end mRNA-Seq data from a panel of estrogen
              receptor (ER)(+), HER2(+), and triple-negative primary breast
              tumors, identifying tumor-specific fusion transcripts by

              epithelial cell cultures plus the Illumina Body Map data from
              normal tissues. We found that every primary breast tumor that was
              analyzed expressed one or more fusion transcripts. Of the 131
              tumor-specific fusion transcripts identified, 86 were ``private''

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in
              cellular homeostasis by controlling gene expression at the
              post-transcriptional level. RESULTS: We explore the expression of
              more than 800 RBPs in sixteen healthy human tissues and their
              patterns of dysregulation in cancer genomes from The Cancer
              Genome Atlas project. We show that genes encoding RBPs are
              consistently and significantly highly expressed compared with
              other classes of genes, including those encoding regulatory
              components such as transcription factors, miRNAs and long
              non-coding RNAs. We also demonstrate that a set of RBPs,
              numbering approximately 30, are strongly upregulated (SUR) across
              at least two-thirds of the nine cancers profiled in this study.
              Analysis of the protein-protein interaction network properties
              for the SUR and non-SUR groups of RBPs suggests that path length
              distributions between SUR RBPs is significantly lower than those
              observed for non-SUR RBPs. We further find that the mean path
              lengths between SUR RBPs increases in proportion to their
              contribution to prognostic impact. We also note that RBPs
              exhibiting higher variability in the extent of dysregulation
              across breast cancer patients have a higher number of
              protein-protein interactions. We propose that fluctuating RBP
              levels might result in an increase in non-specific protein
              interactions, potentially leading to changes in the functional
              consequences of RBP binding. Finally, we show that the expression
              variation of a gene within a patient group is inversely
              correlated with prognostic impact. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our
              results provide a roadmap for understanding the impact of RBPs on
              cancer pathogenesis.",

  author   = "Zhao, Shanrong",
  abstract = "RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome
              profiling. The major challenge in RNA-Seq data analysis is the
              accurate mapping of junction reads to their genomic origins. To
              detect splicing sites in short reads, many RNA-Seq aligners use
              reference transcriptome to inform placement of junction reads.
              However, no systematic evaluation has been performed to assess or
              quantify the benefits of incorporating reference transcriptome in
              mapping RNA-Seq reads. In this paper, we have studied the impact
              of reference transcriptome on mapping RNA-Seq reads, especially
              on junction ones. The same dataset were analysed with and without
              RefGene transcriptome, respectively. Then a Perl script was
              developed to analyse and compare the mapping results. It was
              found that about 50-55\% junction reads can be mapped to the same
              genomic regions regardless of the usage of RefGene model. More
              than one-third of reads fail to be mapped without the help of a
              reference transcriptome. For ``Alternatively'' mapped reads,
              i.e., those reads mapped differently with and without RefGene
              model, the mappings without RefGene model are usually worse than
              their corresponding alignments with RefGene model. For junction
              reads that span more than two exons, it is less likely to align
              them correctly without the assistance of reference transcriptome.
              As the sequencing technology evolves, the read length is becoming
              longer and longer. When reads become longer, they are more likely
              to span multiple exons, and thus the mapping of long junction
              reads is actually becoming more and more challenging without the
              assistance of reference transcriptome. Therefore, the advantages
              of using reference transcriptome in the mapping demonstrated in
              this study are becoming more evident for longer reads. In
              addition, the effect of the completeness of reference
              transcriptome on mapping of RNA-Seq reads is discussed.",

              and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been
              hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we
              present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to
              date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of
              the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes
              producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs
              are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding
              genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing
              signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding
              genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon
              transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin
              and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed

              neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter
              regions, which display levels of selection comparable to
              protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have
              arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of
              their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows
              that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding
              genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with
              a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the

              show particularly striking positive correlation with the

              that SKAP is expressed as two distinct isoforms in mammals: a
              longer, testis-specific isoform that was used for the previous
              studies in mitotic cells and a novel, shorter mitotic isoform.
              Unlike the long isoform, short SKAP rescues SKAP depletion in
              mitosis and displays robust microtubule plus-end tracking,
              including localization to astral microtubules. Eliminating SKAP
              microtubule binding results in severe chromosome segregation

              plus-end tracking facilitate proper chromosome segregation but

  abstract = "Three principal approaches have been proposed for inferring the
              set of transcripts expressed in RNA samples using RNA-seq. The
              simplest approach uses curated annotations, which assumes the
              transcripts in a sample are a subset of the transcripts listed in
              a curated database. A more ambitious method involves aligning
              reads to a reference genome and using the alignments to infer the
              transcript structures, possibly with the aid of a curated
              transcript database. The most challenging approach is to assemble
              reads into putative transcripts de novo without the aid of
              reference data. We have systematically assessed the properties of
              these three approaches through a simulation study. We have found
              that the sensitivity of computational transcript set estimation
              is severely limited. Computational approaches (both genome-guided
              and de novo assembly) produce a large number of artefacts, which
              are assigned large expression estimates and absorb a substantial
              proportion of the signal when performing expression analysis. The
              approach using curated annotations shows good expression
              correlation even when the annotations are incomplete.
              Furthermore, any incorrect transcripts present in a curated set
              do not absorb much signal, so it is preferable to have a curation
              set with high sensitivity than high precision. Software to

  abstract  = "When comparing two independent groups, researchers in Psychology
               commonly use Student's t-test. Assumptions of normality and of
               homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not,
               when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be
               severely biased, and leads to invalid statistical inferences.
               Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will
               seldom hold in psychological research and that choosing between
               Student's t-test or Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a
               test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an
               appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a
               better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of
               homogeneity of variance is not met, and loses little robustness
               compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We
               argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.",

  title    = "t-tests, non-parametric tests, and large studies--a paradox of
              statistical practice?",
  author   = "Fagerland, Morten W",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: During the last 30 years, the median sample size of
              research studies published in high-impact medical journals has
              increased manyfold, while the use of non-parametric tests has
              increased at the expense of t-tests. This paper explores this
              paradoxical practice and illustrates its consequences. METHODS: A
              simulation study is used to compare the rejection rates of the
              Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test and the two-sample t-test for
              increasing sample size. Samples are drawn from skewed
              distributions with equal means and medians but with a small
              difference in spread. A hypothetical case study is used for
              illustration and motivation. RESULTS: The WMW test produces, on
              average, smaller p-values than the t-test. This discrepancy
              increases with increasing sample size, skewness, and difference
              in spread. For heavily skewed data, the proportion of p<0.05 with
              the WMW test can be greater than 90\% if the standard deviations
              differ by 10\% and the number of observations is 1000 in each
              group. The high rejection rates of the WMW test should be
              interpreted as the power to detect that the probability that a
              random sample from one of the distributions is less than a random
              sample from the other distribution is greater than 50\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: Non-parametric tests are most useful for small
              studies. Using non-parametric tests in large studies may provide
              answers to the wrong question, thus confusing readers. For
              studies with a large sample size, t-tests and their corresponding
              confidence intervals can and should be used even for heavily
              skewed data.",

  title    = "Comparison of {High-Level} Microarray Analysis Methods in the
              Context of Result Consistency",
  author   = "Chrominski, Kornel and Tkacz, Magdalena",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: When we were asked for help with high-level
              microarray data analysis (on Affymetrix HGU-133A microarray), we
              faced the problem of selecting an appropriate method. We wanted
              to select a method that would yield ``the best result'' (detected
              as many ``really'' differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as
              possible, without false positives and false negatives). However,
              life scientists could not help us--they use their ``favorite''
              method without special argumentation. We also did not find any
              norm or recommendation. Therefore, we decided to examine it for
              our own purpose. We considered whether the results obtained using
              different methods of high-level microarray data
              analyses--Significant Analysis of Microarrays, Rank Products,
              Bland-Altman, Mann-Whitney test, T test and the Linear Models for
              Microarray Data--would be in agreement. Initially, we conducted a
              comparative analysis of the results on eight real data sets from
              microarray experiments (from the Array Express database). The
              results were surprising. On the same array set, the set of DEGs
              by different methods were significantly different. We also
              applied the methods to artificial data sets and determined some
              measures that allow the preparation of the overall scoring of
              tested methods for future recommendation. RESULTS: We found a
              very low level concordance of results from tested methods on real
              array sets. The number of common DEGs (detected by all six
              methods on fixed array sets, checked on eight array sets) ranged
              from 6 to 433 (22,283 total array readings). Results on
              artificial data sets were better than those on the real data.
              However, they were not fully satisfying. We scored tested methods
              on accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure and Matthews
              correlation coefficient. Based on the overall scoring, the best
              methods were SAM and LIMMA. We also found TT to be acceptable.
              The worst scoring was MW. Based on our study, we recommend: 1.
              Carefully taking into account the need for study when choosing a
              method, 2. Making high-level analysis with more than one method
              and then only taking the genes that are common to all methods
              (which seems to be reasonable) and 3. Being very careful (while
              summarizing facts) about sets of differentially expressed genes:
              different methods discover different sets of DEGs.",

  abstract = "The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions
              for human physiology, as well as rich information about human
              evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing
              Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion
              of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration
              has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high
              accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result
              of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35)
              contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps.
              It covers approximately 99\% of the euchromatic genome and is
              accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000
              bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with
              segmental duplications and will require focused work with new
              methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate,
              greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the
              human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.
              Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000

  abstract = "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the
              euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
              whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
              sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality
              sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends
              of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two
              assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional
              chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from
              Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data
              were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage
              of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without
              including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure
              used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective
              coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and
              size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained
              with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very
              similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data.
              The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the
              human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold
              assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in
              scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome
              sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which
              there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional
              approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse
              matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense
              clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low
              G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding
              sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas
              24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA.
              Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to
              chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and
              reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic
              analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with
              neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation,
              and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence
              comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded
              genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes
              differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was
              marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the
              genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in
              proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional
              consequences remains an open challenge.",

              Methods adopted for each step of EST analysis by various research

              organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts.
              The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of
              its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves
              as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network,
              whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A
              transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total
              transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the
              whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological
              advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a
              widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by
              repeated technological innovations that transform the field.
              There are two key contemporary techniques in the field:
              microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and
              RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing
              to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an
              organism's genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points
              gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details
              of an organism's biology. It can also help to infer the functions
              of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has
              enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different
              organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human
              disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows
              detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned
              by more targeted assays.",

              has proven to be a very powerful approach to discover
              (putatively) expressed sequences that, in turn, once mapped, may
              greatly expedite the process involved in the identification and
              cloning of human disease genes. However, the integrity of the
              data and the pace at which novel sequences can be identified
              depends to a great extent on the cDNA libraries that are used.
              Because altogether, in a typical cell, the mRNAs of the prevalent
              and intermediate frequency classes comprise as much as 50-65\% of
              the total mRNA mass, but represent no more than 1000-2000
              different mRNAs, redundant identification of mRNAs of these two
              frequency classes is destined to become overwhelming relatively
              early in any such random gene discovery programs, thus seriously
              compromising their cost-effectiveness. With the goal of
              facilitating such efforts, previously we developed a method to
              construct directionally cloned normalized cDNA libraries and
              applied it to generate infant brain (INIB) and fetal liver/spleen
              (INFLS) libraries, from which a total of 45,192 and 86,088
              expressed sequence tags, respectively, have been derived. While
              improving the representation of the longest cDNAs in our
              libraries, we developed three additional methods to normalize
              cDNA libraries and generated over 35 libraries, most of which
              have been contributed to our integrated Molecular Analysis of
              Genomes and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium and thus
              distributed widely and used for sequencing and mapping. In an
              attempt to facilitate the process of gene discovery further, we
              have also developed a subtractive hybridization approach designed
              specifically to eliminate (or reduce significantly the
              representation of) large pools of arrayed and (mostly) sequenced
              clones from normalized libraries yet to be (or just partly)
              surveyed. Here we present a detailed description and a
              comparative analysis of four methods that we developed and used

  abstract = "Alternative splicing, defined as the generation of multiple RNA
              transcript species from a common mRNA precursor, is one of the
              mechanisms for the diversification and expansion of cellular
              proteins from a smaller set of genes. Current estimates indicate
              that at least 60\% of genes in the human genome exhibit
              alternative splicing. Over the past decade, alternative splicing
              has increasingly been recognized as a major regulatory process
              with a critical role in normal development. Furthermore, the
              importance of alternative splicing in disease development and
              treatment is starting to be appreciated. Therefore, an increasing
              number of high-throughput genomics and proteomics studies are
              being performed in order to delineate (a) the changes in
              alternative splicing under various conditions; (b) the properties
              and functions of protein isoforms; and (c) the splicing and
              alternative splicing regulation process. Strategies for the
              parallel analysis of alternative splice forms by microarray
              experiments have been conceived, and examples have been
              published. In addition to the differences in microarray probe
              design, the analysis of microarrays with probes for exons,
              exon/exon junctions as well as specific splice forms is
              significantly different from the standard experiment. Several
              methods are being developed in order to address the particular
              needs of alternative splicing microarrays. Many reviews have
              already dealt with alternative splicing. However, high-throughput
              analysis methods that are becoming increasingly popular have not
              received much attention. Here, we will provide an overview of the
              tools and analysis methods that were developed specifically for

  abstract = "Several strong conclusions emerge concerning pre-mRNA processing
              from both old and newer experiments. The RNAPII complex is
              involved with pre-mRNA processing through binding of processing
              proteins to the CTD (carboxyl terminal domain) of the largest
              RNAPII subunit. These interactions are necessary for efficient
              processing, but whether factor binding to the CTD and delivery to
              splicing sites is obligatory or facilitatory is unsettled.
              Capping, addition of an m(7)Gppp residue (cap) to the initial
              transcribed residue of a pre-mRNA, occurs within seconds.
              Splicing of pre-mRNA by spliceosomes at particular sites is most
              likely committed during transcription by the binding of
              initiating processing factors and ∼50\% of the time is completed
              in mammalian cells before completion of the primary transcript.
              This fact has led to an outpouring in the literature about
              ``cotranscriptional splicing.'' However splicing requires several
              minutes for completion and can take longer. The RNAPII complex
              moves through very long introns and also through regions dense
              with alternating exons and introns at an average rate of ∼3 kb
              per min and is, therefore, not likely detained at each splice
              site for more than a few seconds, if at all. Cleavage of the

              high-dimensional gene expression data in terms of biologically
              relevant sets. This is an active area of research and numerous
              gene set analysis methods have been developed. Despite this
              popularity, systematic comparative studies have been limited in
              scope. Methods: In this study we present a semi-synthetic
              simulation study using real datasets in order to test and compare
              commonly used methods. Results: A software pipeline, Flexible
              Algorithm for Novel Gene set Simulation (FANGS) develops
              simulated data based on a prostate cancer dataset where the KRAS
              and TGF-β pathways were differentially expressed. The FANGS
              software is compatible with other datasets and pathways.
              Comparisons of gene set analysis methods are presented for Gene
              Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Significance Analysis of Function
              and Expression (SAFE), sigPathway, and Correlation Adjusted Mean
              RAnk (CAMERA) methods. All gene set analysis methods are tested
              using gene sets from the MSigDB knowledge base. The false
              positive rate and power are estimated and presented for
              comparison. Recommendations are made for the utility of the
              default settings of methods and each method's sensitivity towards
              various effect sizes. Conclusions: The results of this study
              provide empirical guidance to users of gene set analysis methods.

              most popular is the identification of genes that are
              differentially expressed in two conditions. A common statistical
              approach is to quantify the interest of each gene with a p-value,
              adjust these p-values for multiple comparisons, choose an
              appropriate cut-off, and create a list of candidate genes. This
              approach has been criticised for ignoring biological knowledge
              regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of methods,
              that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed.
              However, the most popular method, gene set enrichment analysis
              (GSEA), seems overly complicated. Furthermore, GSEA is based on a
              statistical test known for its lack of sensitivity. In this

              GSEA. We find that this simple solution clearly outperforms GSEA.

  abstract = "There is an immediate need for improved methods to systematically
              and precisely quantify large sets of peptides in complex
              biological samples. To date protein quantification in biological
              samples has been routinely performed on triple quadrupole
              instruments operated in selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM),
              and two major challenges remain. Firstly, the number of peptides
              to be included in one survey experiment needs to be increased to
              routinely reach several hundreds, and secondly, the degree of
              selectivity should be improved so as to reliably discriminate the
              targeted analytes from background interferences. High resolution
              and accurate mass (HR/AM) analysis on the recently developed
              Q-Exactive mass spectrometer can potentially address these
              issues. This instrument presents a unique configuration: it is
              constituted of an orbitrap mass analyzer equipped with a
              quadrupole mass filter as the front-end for precursor ion mass
              selection. This configuration enables new quantitative methods
              based on HR/AM measurements, including targeted analysis in MS
              mode (single ion monitoring) and in MS/MS mode (parallel reaction
              monitoring). The ability of the quadrupole to select a restricted
              m/z range allows one to overcome the dynamic range limitations
              associated with trapping devices, and the MS/MS mode provides an
              additional stage of selectivity. When applied to targeted protein
              quantification in urine samples and benchmarked with the
              reference SRM technique, the quadrupole-orbitrap instrument
              exhibits similar or better performance in terms of selectivity,
              dynamic range, and sensitivity. This high performance is further
              enhanced by leveraging the multiplexing capability of the
              instrument to design novel acquisition methods and apply them to
              large targeted proteomic studies for the first time, as
              demonstrated on 770 tryptic yeast peptides analyzed in one 60-min

              modifications in biological samples of interest. For the last 15
              years, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
              in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode has been the standard
              for proteomics when sampling breadth and discovery were the main
              objectives; multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS/MS has been
              the standard for targeted proteomics when precise quantification,
              reproducibility, and validation were the main objectives.
              Recently, improvements in mass spectrometer design and
              bioinformatics algorithms have resulted in the rediscovery and
              development of another sampling method: data-independent
              acquisition (DIA). DIA comprehensively and repeatedly samples
              every peptide in a protein digest, producing a complex set of
              mass spectra that is difficult to interpret without external
              spectral libraries. Currently, DIA approaches the identification
              breadth of DDA while achieving the reproducible quantification
              characteristic of MRM or its newest version, parallel reaction
              monitoring (PRM). In comparative de novo identification and
              quantification studies in human cell lysates, DIA identified up
              to 89\% of the proteins detected in a comparable DDA experiment
              while providing reproducible quantification of over 85\% of them.
              DIA analysis aided by spectral libraries derived from prior DIA
              experiments or auxiliary DDA data produces identification and
              quantification as reproducible and precise as that achieved by
              MRM/PRM, except on low‑abundance peptides that are obscured by
              stronger signals. DIA is still a work in progress toward the goal
              of sensitive, reproducible, and precise quantification without
              external spectral libraries. New software tools applied to DIA
              analysis have to deal with deconvolution of complex spectra as
              well as proper filtering of false positives and false negatives.
              However, the future outlook is positive, and various researchers
              are working on novel bioinformatics techniques to address these
              issues and increase the reproducibility, fidelity, and
              identification breadth of DIA.",

  abstract = "A variety of stable isotope labeling techniques have been
              developed and used in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics,
              primarily for relative quantitation of changes in protein
              abundances between two compared samples, but also for qualitative
              characterization of differentially labeled proteomes.
              Differential (16)O/(18)O coding relies on the (18)O exchange that
              takes place at the C-terminal carboxyl group of proteolytic
              fragments, where two (16)O atoms are typically replaced by two
              (18)O atoms by enzyme-catalyzed oxygen-exchange in the presence
              of H(2)(18)O. The resulting mass shift between differentially
              labeled peptide ions permits identification, characterization and
              quantitation of proteins from which the peptides are
              proteolytically generated. This review focuses on the utility of
              (16)O/(18)O labeling within the context of mass

              employing (16)O/(18)O are examined in the context of global

  abstract = "Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to
              tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides
              generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However,
              with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly,
              consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect
              and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple
              samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically
              queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially
              any protein of interest. It consists of using the information
              available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete
              fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition
              method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high
              resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument
              by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor
              isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup
              generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment
              ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200
              m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window.
              We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted
              from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently
              identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of
              magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not
              detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried
              peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy
              comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold
              standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data
              extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and
              dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of
              the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of
              unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted
              data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic
              methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive
              analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.",

              quantitative changes within thousands of biologically active
              components such as proteins, lipids and metabolites. The research
              enabled through these methods potentially contributes to the
              diagnosis and pathophysiology of human diseases as well as to the
              clarification of structures and interactions between
              biomolecules. Simultaneously, technological advances in the field
              of mass spectrometry leading to an ever increasing amount of
              data, demand high standards in efficiency, accuracy and
              reproducibility of potential analysis software. RESULTS: This
              article presents the current state and ongoing developments in
              OpenMS, a versatile open-source framework aimed at enabling
              reproducible analyses of high-throughput mass spectrometry data.
              It provides implementations of frequently occurring processing
              operations on MS data through a clean application programming
              interface in C++ and Python. A collection of 185 tools and
              ready-made workflows for typical MS-based experiments enable
              convenient analyses for non-developers and facilitate
              reproducible research without losing flexibility. CONCLUSIONS:
              OpenMS will continue to increase its ease of use for developers
              as well as users with improved continuous integration/deployment

  abstract = "Peptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry is the
              dominant proteomics workflow for protein characterization in
              complex samples. The peptide fragmentation spectra generated by
              these workflows exhibit characteristic fragmentation patterns
              that can be used to identify the peptide. In other fields, where
              the compounds of interest do not have the convenient linear
              structure of peptides, fragmentation spectra are identified by
              comparing new spectra with libraries of identified spectra, an
              approach called spectral matching. In contrast to sequence-based
              tandem mass spectrometry search engines used for peptides,
              spectral matching can make use of the intensities of fragment
              peaks in library spectra to assess the quality of a match. We
              evaluate a hidden Markov model approach (HMMatch) to spectral
              matching, in which many examples of a peptide's fragmentation
              spectrum are summarized in a generative probabilistic model that
              captures the consensus and variation of each peak's intensity. We
              demonstrate that HMMatch has good specificity and superior
              sensitivity, compared to sequence database search engines such as
              X!Tandem. HMMatch achieves good results from relatively few
              training spectra, is fast to train, and can evaluate many spectra
              per second. A statistical significance model permits HMMatch
              scores to be compared with each other, and with other peptide
              identification tools, on a unified scale. HMMatch shows a similar
              degree of concordance with X!Tandem, Mascot, and NIST's MS
              Search, as they do with each other, suggesting that each tool can
              assign peptides to spectra that the others miss. Finally, we show
              that it is possible to extrapolate HMMatch models beyond a single
              peptide's training spectra to the spectra of related peptides,
              expanding the application of spectral matching techniques beyond
              the set of peptides previously observed.",

  abstract = "Several algorithms have been described in the literature for
              protein identification by searching a sequence database using
              mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data
              are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by
              an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
              data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data
              with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new
              computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of
              search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a
              number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge
              whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly
              useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be
              compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence
              homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by

  abstract = "In shotgun proteomics, the quality of a hypothesized match
              between an observed spectrum and a peptide sequence is quantified
              by a score function. Because the score function lies at the heart
              of any peptide identification pipeline, this function greatly
              affects the final results of a proteomics assay. Consequently,
              valid statistical methods for assessing the quality of a given
              score function are extremely important. Previously, several
              research groups have used samples of known protein composition to
              assess the quality of a given score function. We demonstrate that
              this approach is problematic, because the outcome can depend on
              factors other than the score function itself. We then propose an
              alternative use of the same type of data to validate a score
              function. The central idea of our approach is that database
              matches that are not explained by any protein in the purified
              sample comprise a robust representation of incorrect matches. We
              apply our alternative assessment scheme to several commonly used
              score functions, and we show that our approach generates a
              reproducible measure of the calibration of a given peptide
              identification method. Furthermore, we show how our quality test
              can be useful in the development of novel score functions.",

  abstract = "A very important category of clustering methods is hierarchical
              clustering. There are considerable research efforts which have
              been focused on algorithm-level improvements of the hierarchical
              clustering process. In this paper, our goal is to provide a
              systematic understanding of hierarchical clustering from a data
              distribution perspective. Specifically, we investigate the issues
              about how the ``true'' cluster distribution can make impact on
              the clustering performance, and what is the relationship between
              hierarchical clustering schemes and validation measures with
              respect to different data distributions. To this end, we provide
              an organized study to illustrate these issues. Indeed, one of our
              key findings reveals that hierarchical clustering tends to
              produce clusters with high variation on cluster sizes regardless
              of ``true'' cluster distributions. Also, our results show that
              F-measure, an external clustering validation measure, has bias
              towards hierarchical clustering algorithms which tend to increase
              the variation on cluster sizes. Viewed in light of this, we
              propose Fnorm, the normalized version of the F-measure, to solve
              the cluster validation problem for hierarchical clustering.
              Experimental results show that Fnorm is indeed more suitable than
              the unnormalized F-measure in evaluating the hierarchical
              clustering results across data sets with different data

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Batch effects are a persistent and pervasive form of
              measurement noise which undermine the scientific utility of
              high-throughput genomic datasets. At their most benign, they
              reduce the power of statistical tests resulting in actual effects
              going unidentified. At their worst, they constitute confounds and
              render datasets useless. Attempting to remove batch effects will
              result in some of the biologically meaningful component of the
              measurement (i.e. signal) being lost. We present and benchmark a
              novel technique, called Harman. Harman maximises the removal of
              batch noise with the constraint that the risk of also losing
              biologically meaningful component of the measurement is kept to a
              fraction which is set by the user. RESULTS: Analyses of three
              independent publically available datasets reveal that Harman
              removes more batch noise and preserves more signal at the same
              time, than the current leading technique. Results also show that
              Harman is able to identify and remove batch effects no matter
              what their relative size compared to other sources of variation
              in the dataset. Of particular advantage for meta-analyses and
              data integration is Harman's superior consistency in achieving
              comparable noise suppression - signal preservation trade-offs
              across multiple datasets, with differing number of treatments,
              replicates and processing batches. CONCLUSION: Harman's ability
              to better remove batch noise, and better preserve biologically
              meaningful signal simultaneously within a single study, and
              maintain the user-set trade-off between batch noise rejection and
              signal preservation across different studies makes it an
              effective alternative method to deal with batch effects in
              high-throughput genomic datasets. Harman is flexible in terms of
              the data types it can process. It is available publically as an R

              effects and other unwanted variation. Many methods have been
              proposed to adjust microarray data to mitigate the problems of
              unwanted variation. Several of these methods rely on factor
              analysis to infer the unwanted variation from the data. A central
              problem with this approach is the difficulty in discerning the
              unwanted variation from the biological variation that is of
              interest to the researcher. We present a new method, intended for
              use in differential expression studies, that attempts to overcome
              this problem by restricting the factor analysis to negative
              control genes. Negative control genes are genes known a priori
              not to be differentially expressed with respect to the biological
              factor of interest. Variation in the expression levels of these
              genes can therefore be assumed to be unwanted variation. We name
              this method ``Remove Unwanted Variation, 2-step'' (RUV-2). We
              discuss various techniques for assessing the performance of an
              adjustment method and compare the performance of RUV-2 with that
              of other commonly used adjustment methods such as Combat and
              Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We present several example
              studies, each concerning genes differentially expressed with
              respect to gender in the brain and find that RUV-2 performs as
              well or better than other methods. Finally, we discuss the
              possibility of adapting RUV-2 for use in studies not concerned

              RNA-seq data analysis. One often-overlooked aspect is
              normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of factors or
              'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data,
              commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for

              problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety of

              experiments further add to the challenge and there are strong
              differences in opinion regarding the conceptual validity of a
              protein FDR and no consensus regarding the methodology for
              protein FDR determination. There are also limitations inherent to
              the widely used classic target-decoy strategy that particularly
              show when analyzing very large data sets and that lead to a
              strong over-representation of decoy identifications. In this
              study, we investigated the merits of the classic, as well as a
              novel target-decoy-based protein FDR estimation approach, taking
              advantage of a heterogeneous data collection comprised of ∼19,000
              LC-MS/MS runs deposited in ProteomicsDB
              (https://www.proteomicsdb.org). The ``picked'' protein FDR
              approach treats target and decoy sequences of the same protein as
              a pair rather than as individual entities and chooses either the
              target or the decoy sequence depending on which receives the
              highest score. We investigated the performance of this approach
              in combination with q-value based peptide scoring to normalize
              sample-, instrument-, and search engine-specific differences. The
              ``picked'' target-decoy strategy performed best when protein
              scoring was based on the best peptide q-value for each protein
              yielding a stable number of true positive protein identifications
              over a wide range of q-value thresholds. We show that this simple
              and unbiased strategy eliminates a conceptual issue in the
              commonly used ``classic'' protein FDR approach that causes
              overprediction of false-positive protein identification in large
              data sets. The approach scales from small to very large data sets
              without losing performance, consistently increases the number of

               to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
               rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple

              commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS
              spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic
              strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular
              attention is paid to the problem of false-positive
              identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing
              the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed,
              ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation
              values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false
              discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of
              using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide
              separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is
              discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint
              modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This
              review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting
              the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the
              amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein
              level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample

  abstract = "The potential of getting a significant number of false positives
              (FPs) in peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained by proteomic
              database search has been well-recognized. Among the attempts to
              assess FPs, the concomitant use of target and decoy databases is
              widely practiced. By adjusting filtering criteria, FPs and false
              discovery rate (FDR) can be controlled at a desired level.
              Although the target-decoy approach is gaining in popularity,
              subtle differences in decoy construction (e.g., reversing vs
              stochastic methods), rate calculation (e.g., total vs unique
              PSMs), or searching (separate vs composite) do exist among
              various implementations. In the present study, we evaluated the
              effects of these differences on FP and FDR estimations using a
              rat kidney protein sample and the SEQUEST search engine as an
              example. On the effects of decoy construction, we found that,
              when a single scoring filter (XCorr) was used, stochastic methods
              generated a higher estimation of FPs and FDR than sequence
              reversing methods, likely due to an increase in unique peptides.
              This higher estimation could largely be attenuated by creating
              decoy databases similar in effective size but not by a simple
              normalization with a unique-peptide coefficient. When multiple
              filters were applied, the differences seen between reversing and
              stochastic methods significantly diminished, suggesting multiple
              filterings reduce the dependency on how a decoy is constructed.
              For a fixed set of filtering criteria, FDR and FPs estimated by
              using unique PSMs were almost twice those using total PSMs. The
              higher estimation seemed to be dependent on data acquisition
              setup. As to the differences between performing separate or
              composite searches, in general, FDR estimated from the separate
              search was about three times that from the composite search. The
              degree of difference gradually decreased as the filtering
              criteria became more stringent. Paradoxically, the estimated true
              positives in separate search were higher when multiple filters
              were used. By analyzing a standard protein mixture, we
              demonstrated that the higher estimation of FDR and FPs in the
              separate search likely reflected an overestimation, which could
              be corrected with a simple merging procedure. Our study
              illustrates the relative merits of different implementations of
              the target-decoy strategy, which should be worth contemplating
              when large-scale proteomic biomarker discovery is to be
              attempted.",

              identifications from tandem mass spectra is essential in mass
              spectrometry based proteomics experiments. These statistics are
              dependent on accurately modelling random identifications. The
              target-decoy approach has risen to become the de facto approach
              to calculating FDR in proteomic datasets. The main principle of
              this approach is to search a set of decoy protein sequences that
              emulate the size and composition of the target protein sequences
              searched whilst not matching real proteins in the sample. To do
              this, it is commonplace to reverse or shuffle the proteins and
              peptides in the target database. However, these approaches have
              their drawbacks and limitations. A key confounding issue is the
              peptide redundancy between target and decoy databases leading to
              inaccurate FDR estimation. This inaccuracy is further amplified
              at the protein level and when searching large sequence databases
              such as those used for proteogenomics. Here, we present a
              unifying hybrid method to quickly and efficiently generate decoy
              sequences with minimal overlap between target and decoy peptides.
              We show that applying a reversed decoy approach can produce up to
              5\% peptide redundancy and many more additional peptides will
              have the exact same precursor mass as a target peptide. Our
              hybrid method addresses both these issues by first switching
              proteolytic cleavage sites with preceding amino acid, reversing
              the database and then shuffling any redundant sequences. This
              flexible hybrid method reduces the peptide overlap between target
              and decoy peptides to about 1\% of peptides, making a more robust
              decoy model suitable for large search spaces. We also demonstrate
              the anti-conservative effect of redundant peptides on the
              calculation of q-values in mouse brain tissue data.",

              analyzed. It was found combinations involving Percolator achieved
              markedly more peptide and protein identifications at the same FDR
              level than the other 12 combinations for all data sets. Among
              these, combinations of SEQUEST-Percolator and MS
              Amanda-Percolator provided slightly better performances for data
              sets with low-accuracy MS2 (ion trap or IT) and high accuracy MS2
              (Orbitrap or TOF), respectively, than did other methods. For
              approaches without Percolator, SEQUEST-group performs the best
              for data sets with MS2 produced by collision-induced dissociation
              (CID) and IT analysis; Mascot-LFDR gives more identifications for
              data sets generated by higher-energy collisional dissociation
              (HCD) and analyzed in Orbitrap (HCD-OT) and in Orbitrap Fusion
              (HCD-IT); MS Amanda-Group excels for the Q-TOF data set and the
              Orbitrap Velos HCD-OT data set. Therefore, if Percolator was not
              used, a specific combination should be applied for each type of
              data set. Moreover, a higher percentage of multiple-peptide
              proteins and lower variation of protein spectral counts were
              observed when analyzing technical replicates using
              Percolator-associated combinations; therefore, Percolator
              enhanced the reliability for both identification and
              quantification. The analyses were performed using the specific
              programs embedded in Proteome Discoverer, Scaffold, and an
              in-house algorithm (BuildSummary). These results provide valuable
              guidelines for the optimal interpretation of proteomic results

              imputation methods for proteomics application. Although
              insightful, these comparisons do not account for two important

              most appropriate one. We describe a series of comparisons that

              outperform a blindly applied, supposedly ``better-performing''
              method (i.e., the reference method from the state-of-the-art).
              This leads us to formulate few practical guidelines regarding the

              mass-to-charge ratio of ionized atoms or molecules, dates back
              more than 100 years, and has both qualitative and quantitative
              uses for determining chemical and structural information.
              Quantitative proteomic mass spectrometry on biological samples
              focuses on identifying the proteins present in the samples, and
              establishing the relative abundances of those proteins. Such
              protein inventories create the opportunity to discover novel
              biomarkers and disease targets. We have previously introduced a
              normalized, label-free method for quantification of protein
              abundances under a shotgun proteomics platform (Griffin et al.,
              2010). The introduction of this method for quantifying and
              comparing protein levels leads naturally to the issue of modeling
              protein abundances in individual samples. We here report that
              protein abundance levels from two recent proteomics experiments
              conducted by the authors can be adequately represented by Sichel
              distributions. Mathematically, Sichel distributions are mixtures
              of Poisson distributions with a rather complex mixing
              distribution, and have been previously and successfully applied
              to linguistics and species abundance data. The Sichel model can
              provide a direct measure of the heterogeneity of protein
              abundances, and can reveal protein abundance differences that
              simpler models fail to show.",

              technique to control for errors in such lists is to enforce a
              preset threshold for the false discovery rate (FDR). Many
              consider protein-level FDRs a difficult and vague concept, as the

              Specifically, we point out that two competing null hypotheses are
              used concurrently in today's protein inference methods, which has
              gone unnoticed by many. Using simulations of a shotgun proteomics
              experiment, we show how confusing one null hypothesis for the
              other can lead to serious discrepancies in the FDR. Furthermore,
              we demonstrate how the same simulations can be used to verify FDR
              estimates of protein inference methods. In particular, we show
              that, for a simple protein inference method, decoy models can be

              standard sample analyzed by a standard proteomics routine and
              argue that it is an intrinsic property of the peptide sequence
              and neighboring regions in the parent protein. To test this
              hypothesis we first used publicly available data and data from
              our own synthetic samples in which quantities of model proteins
              were controlled. We then applied machine learning approaches to
              demonstrate that peptide detectability can be predicted from its
              sequence and the neighboring regions in the parent protein with
              satisfactory accuracy. The utility of this approach for protein
              quantification is demonstrated by peptides with higher
              detectability generally being identified at lower concentrations
              over those with lower detectability in the synthetic protein
              mixtures. These results establish a direct link between protein
              concentration and peptide detectability. We show that for each
              protein there exists a level of peptide detectability above which
              peptides are detected and below which peptides are not detected
              in an experiment. We call this level the minimum acceptable
              detectability for identified peptides (MDIP) which can be
              calibrated to predict protein concentration. Triplicate analysis
              of a biological sample showed that these MDIP values are
              consistent among the three data sets.",

              of identified peptides to the proteins from which they originate,
              referred to as the protein inference problem. Redundant and
              homologous protein sequences present a challenge in being
              correctly identified, as a set of peptides may in many cases
              represent multiple proteins. One simple solution to this problem
              is the assignment of the smallest number of proteins that
              explains the identified peptides. However, it is not certain that
              a natural system should be accurately represented using this
              minimalist approach. In this paper, we propose a reformulation of

              By integrating protein expression data with large-scale

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tissue-specific RNA plasticity broadly impacts the
              development, tissue identity and adaptability of all organisms,
              but changes in composition, expression levels and its impact on
              gene regulation in different somatic tissues are largely unknown.
              Here we developed a new method, polyA-tagging and sequencing
              (PAT-Seq) to isolate high-quality tissue-specific mRNA from
              Caenorhabditis elegans intestine, pharynx and body muscle tissues
              and study changes in their tissue-specific transcriptomes and
              3'UTRomes. RESULTS: We have identified thousands of novel genes
              and isoforms differentially expressed between these three
              tissues. The intestine transcriptome is expansive, expressing
              over 30\% of C. elegans mRNAs, while muscle transcriptomes are
              smaller but contain characteristic unique gene signatures. Active
              promoter regions in all three tissues reveal both known and novel
              enriched tissue-specific elements, along with putative
              transcription factors, suggesting novel tissue-specific modes of
              transcription initiation. We have precisely mapped approximately
              20,000 tissue-specific polyadenylation sites and discovered that
              about 30\% of transcripts in somatic cells use alternative
              polyadenylation in a tissue-specific manner, with their 3'UTR
              isoforms significantly enriched with microRNA targets.
              CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, PAT-Seq allowed us to directly
              study tissue specific gene expression changes in an in vivo
              setting and compare these changes between three somatic tissues
              from the same organism at single-base resolution within the same
              experiment. We pinpoint precise tissue-specific transcriptome
              rearrangements and for the first time link tissue-specific
              alternative polyadenylation to miRNA regulation, suggesting novel
              and unexplored tissue-specific post-transcriptional regulatory

              acquisition from the highest abundant signals to the lowest. An
              alternative to DDA is data-independent acquisition (DIA), a
              process in which a specified range in m/z is fragmented without
              regard to prioritization of a precursor ion or its relative
              abundance in the mass spectrum, thus potentially offering a more
              comprehensive analysis of peptides than DDA. In this work, we
              evaluate both DDA and DIA on three different linear ion trap
              instruments: an LTQ, an LTQ modified with an electrodynamic ion
              funnel, and an LTQ Velos. These instruments represent both older
              (LTQ) and newer (LTQ Velos) ion trap designs (i.e., linear versus
              dual ion traps, respectively), and allow direct comparison of
              peptide identifications using both DDA and DIA analysis. Further,
              as the LTQ Velos has an enhanced ``S-lens'' ion guide to improve

              model could be leveraged by improving sensitivity by modifying
              with an electrodynamic ion guide of significantly different
              design to the S-lens. We find that the ion funnel enabled LTQ
              identifies more proteins in the insoluble fraction of a yeast
              lysate than the other two instruments in DIA mode, whereas the
              faster scanning LTQ Velos performs better in DDA mode. We explore

              heart of discovery proteomics. Although this variation impacts
              the identification of peptides, proteomic identifications are far
              from completely random. In this study, we analyzed
              interlaboratory data sets from the NCI Clinical Proteomic
              Technology Assessment for Cancer to examine repeatability and
              reproducibility in peptide and protein identifications. Included
              data spanned 144 LC-MS/MS experiments on four Thermo LTQ and four
              Orbitrap instruments. Samples included yeast lysate, the NCI-20
              defined dynamic range protein mix, and the Sigma UPS 1 defined
              equimolar protein mix. Some of our findings reinforced
              conventional wisdom, such as repeatability and reproducibility
              being higher for proteins than for peptides. Most lessons from
              the data, however, were more subtle. Orbitraps proved capable of
              higher repeatability and reproducibility, but aberrant
              performance occasionally erased these gains. Even the simplest
              protein digestions yielded more peptide ions than LC-MS/MS could
              identify during a single experiment. We observed that peptide
              lists from pairs of technical replicates overlapped by 35-60\%,
              giving a range for peptide-level repeatability in these
              experiments. Sample complexity did not appear to affect peptide
              identification repeatability, even as numbers of identified
              spectra changed by an order of magnitude. Statistical analysis of
              protein spectral counts revealed greater stability across
              technical replicates for Orbitraps, making them superior to LTQ
              instruments for biomarker candidate discovery. The most
              repeatable peptides were those corresponding to conventional
              tryptic cleavage sites, those that produced intense MS signals,
              and those that resulted from proteins generating many distinct
              peptides. Reproducibility among different instruments of the same
              type lagged behind repeatability of technical replicates on a
              single instrument by several percent. These findings reinforce

              aims to account for the bias and make samples more comparable.
              The selection of a proper normalization method is a pivotal task
              for the reliability of the downstream analysis and results. Many
              normalization methods commonly used in proteomics have been
              adapted from the DNA microarray techniques. Previous studies
              comparing normalization methods in proteomics have focused mainly
              on intragroup variation. In this study, several popular and
              widely used normalization methods representing different
              strategies in normalization are evaluated using three spike-in
              and one experimental mouse label-free proteomic data sets. The
              normalization methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to
              reduce variation between technical replicates, their effect on
              differential expression analysis and their effect on the
              estimation of logarithmic fold changes. Additionally, we examined
              whether normalizing the whole data globally or in segments for
              the differential expression analysis has an effect on the
              performance of the normalization methods. We found that variance
              stabilization normalization (Vsn) reduced variation the most
              between technical replicates in all examined data sets. Vsn also
              performed consistently well in the differential expression

  abstract = "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that infects more
              than 90\% of the world's population 1 . EBV predominantly infects
              human B cells and epithelial cells, which is initiated by fusion
              of the viral envelope with a host cellular membrane 2.
              The mechanism of EBV entry into B cells has been well characterized
              3. However, the mechanism for epithelial cell entry remains
              elusive. Here, we show that the integrins αvβ5, αvβ6 and αvβ8 do
              not function as entry and fusion receptors for epithelial cells,
              whereas Ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) functions well
              for both. EphA2 overexpression significantly increased EBV
              infection of HEK293 cells. Using a virus-free cell-cell fusion
              assay, we found that EphA2 dramatically promoted EBV but not
              herpes simplex virus (HSV) fusion with HEK293 cells. EphA2
              silencing using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or knockout by
              CRISPR-Cas9 blocked fusion with epithelial cells. This inhibitory
              effect was rescued by the expression of EphA2. Antibody against
              EphA2 blocked epithelial cell infection. Using label-free surface
              plasmon resonance binding studies, we confirmed that EphA2 but
              not EphA4 specifically bound to EBV gHgL and this interaction is
              through the EphA2 extracellular domain (ECD). The discovery of
              EphA2 as an EBV epithelial cell receptor has important
              implications for EBV pathogenesis and may uncover new potential
              targets that can be used for the development of novel
              intervention strategies.",
