    Abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the
        transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs} and proteins.
            Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the
            entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale.
            Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein abundance
            and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than
            5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and protein levels
            correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives
            showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the
            first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and
            proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is
            predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with
            similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional
            properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and
            dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of
            gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a
            greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

    Abstract = {Co-expression networks have proven effective at assigning putative
        functions to genes based on the functional annotation of their
            co-expressed partners, in candidate gene prioritization studies and in
            improving our understanding of regulatory networks. The growing number
            of genome resequencing efforts and genome-wide association studies
            often identify loci containing novel genes and there is a need to infer
            their functions and interaction partners. To facilitate this we have
            expanded {GeneFriends,} an online database that allows users to
            identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This
            expansion entails an {RNA-seq-based} co-expression map that includes
            genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based
            co-expression maps, including over 10 000 non-coding {RNAs.}
        The results users obtain from {GeneFriends} include a co-expression network
            as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the
            co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database
            for different splice variants and {ncRNAs,} such as {microRNAs} and
            {lincRNAs.} Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts
        to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association
            approach. {GeneFriends} is freely available from
            {http://www.GeneFriends.org} and can be used to quickly identify and
        rank candidate targets relevant to the process or disease under study.},

    Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} methods for analyzing {RNA}
            populations {(RNA-Seq)} are gaining rapid application to many
            experimental situations. The steps in an {RNA-Seq} experiment
            require thought and planning, especially because the expense in
            time and materials is currently higher and the protocols are far
            less routine than those used for other high-throughput methods,
            such as microarrays. As always, good experimental design will make
            analysis and interpretation easier. Having a clear biological
            question, an idea about the best way to do the experiment,
            and an understanding of the number of replicates needed will make
            the entire process more satisfying. Whether the goal is capturing
            transcriptome complexity from a tissue or identifying small
            fragments of {RNA} cross-linked to a protein of interest,
            conversion of the {RNA} to {cDNA} followed by direct sequencing
            using the latest methods is a developing practice, with new
            technical modifications and applications appearing every day.
            Even more rapid are the development and improvement of methods
            for analysis of the very large amounts of data that arrive at
            the end of an {RNA-Seq} experiment, making considerations regarding
            reproducibility, validation, visualization, and interpretation
            increasingly important. This introduction is designed to review and
            emphasize a pathway of analysis from experimental design through data
            presentation that is likely to be successful, with the recognition
            that better methods are right around the corner.},

    Abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the
            biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized
            the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level
            through analysis of {RNA} deep sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} data across
            human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that
            roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed,
            contributing to around 75\% of all {mRNAs} by message copy number
            in most tissues. These {mRNAs} encoded proteins that were often
            intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism,
            transcription, {RNA} processing or translation. In contrast,
            genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally
            expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression
            levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
            concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates
            that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better
            with {qRT-PCR} data than estimates which also included 3'
            untranslated regions {(UTRs).} Muscle and liver had the least
            complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly
            ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a
            few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis
            expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of
            genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most
            expressed genes. {mRNAs} expressed in brain had unusually long
            {3'UTRs,} and mean {3'UTR} length was higher for genes involved in
            development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added
            complexity of {UTR-based} regulation for these genes. Our results
            support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a
            large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
            intracellular proteins.},

    Abstract = {Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various
        human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human
            physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics
            studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across
            tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the
            molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating
            comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a
            tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human
            transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent
            genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues.
            Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets,
            generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and
            postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different

            are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted
            manner. Moreover, we discuss the applications of publicly available

            sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse Th2 cells, coupled with a range of

            proteomics data. Since the beginning of 2014, PRIDE Archive
            (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) is the new PRIDE archival
            system, replacing the original PRIDE database. Here we summarize
            the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the
            previous update manuscript in the Database Issue in 2013. PRIDE
            Archive constitutes a complete redevelopment of the original PRIDE,
            comprising a new storage backend, data submission system and web
            interface, among other components. PRIDE Archive supports the
            most-widely used PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative) data
            standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements the data
            requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium.
            The wide adoption of ProteomeXchange within the community has
            triggered an unprecedented increase in the number of submitted data
            sets (around 150 data sets per month). We outline some statistics

    Abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular
        species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms
            due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a
            polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation
            sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues.
            ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far
            exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA
            methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses
            both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show
            enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC.
            Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher
            levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial
            than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed,
        particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi
            syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly
            expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater
            than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find
            novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries.
            This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates
            the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns,
        their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.},

    Title={Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes},
    Abstract={Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual
        mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may
        have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an
        in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes
        on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding
        a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which
        sequence reads are mapped to exon–exon junctions indicated that 92–94\% of
        human genes undergo alternative splicing, ~86\% with a minor isoform
        frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities
        indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and
        polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between
        individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme
        or ‘switch-like’ regulation of splicing between tissues was associated
        with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with
        generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative
        splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly
        correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these
        processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory
        motifs in both alternative introns and 3′ untranslated regions suggested
        common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both
        splicing and polyadenylation.},

        through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is
            not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across

            mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented

            are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only
            a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of
            previously unknown, lineage-specific, and conserved alternative exons
            were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of
            binding by {MBNL,} {PTB,} {RBFOX,} {STAR,} and {TIA} family splicing
            factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators.

                 analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently
                 prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the
                 sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten
                 species that represent all major mammalian lineages
                 (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the
                 evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the
                 dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that
                 the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs,
                 lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective
                 pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues
                 and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and
                 monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its
                 formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was
                 strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous
                 potentially selectively driven expression switches, which
                 occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and
                 which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of

            By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning

            differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate
            lineages, with the highest complexity in primates.
            Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically
            equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related
            to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most
            vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed.
            However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to
            remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators.
            These events likely further contributed to the diversification of
            splicing and other transcriptomic changes that underlie phenotypic

      However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each
          of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of
          each protein. Uhl{\'e}n et al. now present a map of protein expression
          across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA
          level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the
          corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of
          expression patterns across the human body. Resolving the molecular
          details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of
          the human body would greatly increase our knowledge of human biology
          and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based
          on quantitative transcriptomics on a tissue and organ level combined
          with protein profiling using microarray-based immunohistochemistry to
          achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level.
          We provide a global analysis of the secreted and membrane proteins, as
          well as an analysis of the expression profiles for all proteins
          targeted by pharmaceutical drugs and proteins implicated in cancer.
          RATIONALE We have used an integrative omics approach to study the
          spatial human proteome. Samples representing all major tissues and
          organs (n = 44) in the human body have been analyzed based on 24,028
          antibodies corresponding to 16,975 protein-encoding genes,
      complemented with RNA-sequencing data for 32 of the tissues. The antibodies
          have been used to produce more than 13 million tissue-based
          immunohistochemistry images, each annotated by pathologists for all
          sampled tissues. To facilitate integration with other biological
          resources, all data are available for download and cross-referencing.
          RESULTSWe report a genome-wide analysis of the tissue specificity of
          RNA and protein expression covering more than 90\% of the putative
          protein-coding genes, complemented with analyses of various subproteomes,
          such as predicted secreted proteins (n = 3171) and membrane-bound
          proteins (n = 5570). The analysis shows that almost half of the genes
          are expressed in all analyzed tissues, which suggests that the gene
          products are needed in all cells to maintain
          {\textquotedblleft}housekeeping{\textquotedblright} functions such as
      cell growth, energy generation, and basic metabolism. Furthermore, there is
          enrichment in metabolism among these genes, as 60\% of all metabolic
          enzymes are expressed in all analyzed tissues. The largest number of
          tissue-enriched genes is found in the testis, followed by the brain
          and the liver. Analysis of the 618 proteins targeted by clinically
          approved drugs unexpectedly showed that 30\% are expressed in all
          analyzed tissues. An analysis of metabolic activity based on
          genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS) revealed liver as the most
          metabolically active tissue, followed by adipose tissue and skeletal
          muscle.
          CONCLUSIONSA freely available interactive resource is presented as
          part of the Human Protein Atlas portal (www.proteinatlas.org),
          offering the possibility to explore the tissue-elevated proteomes
          in tissues and organs and to analyze tissue profiles for specific
          protein classes. Comprehensive lists of proteins expressed at elevated
          levels in the different tissues have been compiled to provide a spatial
          context with localization of the proteins in the subcompartments of
          each tissue and organ down to the single-cell level.The human
          tissue{\textendash}enriched proteins.All tissue-enriched proteins are
          shown for 13 representative tissues or groups of tissues, stratified
          according to their predicted subcellular localization. Enriched
          proteins are mainly intracellular in testis, mainly membrane bound in
          brain and kidney, and mainly secreted in pancreas and liver.Resolving
          the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues
          and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of
          human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue
          proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves
          quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined
          with tissue microarray{\textendash}based immunohistochemistry, to
          achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell
          level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90\% of the
          putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore
          the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome,
          the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different
          tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive
          Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins,
          as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major
         tissues and organs in the human body.},

            investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals

            associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is
            the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing
            mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a
            more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its
            stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in
            defining individual phenotypes.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is subdivided
                 into different anatomical organs with many shared functions
                 and characteristics, but also distinct differences. We have
                 combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with
                 immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to describe the
                 gene and protein expression patterns that define the human
                 GIT. METHODS: RNA sequencing data derived from stomach,
                 duodenum, jejunum/ileum and colon specimens were compared to
                 gene expression levels in 23 other normal human tissues
                 analysed with the same method. Protein profiling based on
                 immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays was used to
                 sub-localize the corresponding proteins with GIT-specific
                 expression into sub-cellular compartments and cell types.
                 RESULTS: Approximately 75\% of all human protein-coding genes
                 were expressed in at least one of the GIT tissues. Only 51
                 genes showed enriched expression in either one of the GIT
                 tissues and an additional 83 genes were enriched in two or
                 more GIT tissues. The list of GIT-enriched genes with
                 validated protein expression patterns included various
                 well-known but also previously uncharacterised or poorly
                 studied genes. For instance, the colon-enriched expression of
                 NXPE family member 1 (NXPE1) was established, while NLR
                 family, pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6) expression was
                 primarily found in the human small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: We
                 have applied a genome-wide analysis based on transcriptomics
                 and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes that
                 are expressed in a specific manner within the human GIT. These
                 genes and proteins constitute important starting points for an
                 improved understanding of the normal function and the
                 different states of disease associated with the GIT.},

  Abstract    = {Protein noise measurements are increasingly used to elucidate
                 biophysical parameters. Unfortunately noise analyses are often
                 at odds with directly measured parameters. Here we show that
                 these inconsistencies arise from two problematic analytical
                 choices: (i) the assumption that protein translation rate is
                 invariant for different proteins of different abundances,
                 which has inadvertently led to (ii) the assumption that a
                 large constitutive extrinsic noise sets the low noise limit in
                 gene expression. While growing evidence suggests that
                 transcriptional bursting may set the low noise limit,
                 variability in translational bursting has been largely
                 ignored. We show that genome-wide systematic variation in
                 translational efficiency can-and in the case of E. coli
                 does-control the low noise limit in gene expression. Therefore
                 constitutive extrinsic noise is small and only plays a role in
                 the absence of a systematic variation in translational
                 efficiency. These results show the existence of two distinct
                 expression noise patterns: (1) a global noise floor uniformly
                 imposed on all genes by expression bursting; and (2) high
                 noise distributed to only a select group of genes.},

                 equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements
                 of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a
                 draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution
                 Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic
                 profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including
                 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary
                 haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins
                 encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84\% of
                 the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique

  Abstract    = {This letter analyzes two large-scale proteomics studies
                 published in the same issue of Nature. At the time of the
                 release, both studies were portrayed as draft maps of the
                 human proteome and great advances in the field. As with the
                 initial publication of the human genome, these papers have
                 broad appeal and will no doubt lead to a great deal of further
                 analysis by the scientific community. However, we were
                 intrigued by the number of protein-coding genes detected by
                 the two studies, numbers that far exceeded what has been
                 reported for the multinational Human Proteome Project effort.
                 We carried out a simple quality test on the data using the
                 olfactory receptor family. A high-quality proteomics
                 experiment that does not specifically analyze nasal tissues
                 should not expect to detect many peptides for olfactory
                 receptors. Neither of the studies carried out experiments on
                 nasal tissues, yet we found peptide evidence for more than 100
                 olfactory receptors in the two studies. These results suggest
                 that the two studies are substantially overestimating the
                 number of protein coding genes they identify. We conclude that
                 the experimental data from these two studies should be used
