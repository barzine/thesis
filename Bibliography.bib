    Abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the
        transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs} and proteins.
            Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the
            entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale.
            Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein abundance
            and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than
            5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and protein levels
            correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives
            showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the
            first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and
            proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is
            predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with
            similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional
            properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and
            dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of
            gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a
            greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

    Abstract = {Co-expression networks have proven effective at assigning putative
        functions to genes based on the functional annotation of their
            co-expressed partners, in candidate gene prioritization studies and in
            improving our understanding of regulatory networks. The growing number
            of genome resequencing efforts and genome-wide association studies
            often identify loci containing novel genes and there is a need to infer
            their functions and interaction partners. To facilitate this we have
            expanded {GeneFriends,} an online database that allows users to
            identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This
            expansion entails an {RNA-seq-based} co-expression map that includes
            genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based
            co-expression maps, including over 10 000 non-coding {RNAs.}
        The results users obtain from {GeneFriends} include a co-expression network
            as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the
            co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database
            for different splice variants and {ncRNAs,} such as {microRNAs} and
            {lincRNAs.} Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts
        to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association
            approach. {GeneFriends} is freely available from
            {http://www.GeneFriends.org} and can be used to quickly identify and
        rank candidate targets relevant to the process or disease under study.},

    Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} methods for analyzing {RNA}
            populations {(RNA-Seq)} are gaining rapid application to many
            experimental situations. The steps in an {RNA-Seq} experiment
            require thought and planning, especially because the expense in
            time and materials is currently higher and the protocols are far
            less routine than those used for other high-throughput methods,
            such as microarrays. As always, good experimental design will make
            analysis and interpretation easier. Having a clear biological
            question, an idea about the best way to do the experiment,
            and an understanding of the number of replicates needed will make
            the entire process more satisfying. Whether the goal is capturing
            transcriptome complexity from a tissue or identifying small
            fragments of {RNA} cross-linked to a protein of interest,
            conversion of the {RNA} to {cDNA} followed by direct sequencing
            using the latest methods is a developing practice, with new
            technical modifications and applications appearing every day.
            Even more rapid are the development and improvement of methods
            for analysis of the very large amounts of data that arrive at
            the end of an {RNA-Seq} experiment, making considerations regarding
            reproducibility, validation, visualization, and interpretation
            increasingly important. This introduction is designed to review and
            emphasize a pathway of analysis from experimental design through data
            presentation that is likely to be successful, with the recognition
            that better methods are right around the corner.},

    Abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the
            biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized
            the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level
            through analysis of {RNA} deep sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} data across
            human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that
            roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed,
            contributing to around 75\% of all {mRNAs} by message copy number
            in most tissues. These {mRNAs} encoded proteins that were often
            intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism,
            transcription, {RNA} processing or translation. In contrast,
            genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally
            expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression
            levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
            concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates
            that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better
            with {qRT-PCR} data than estimates which also included 3'
            untranslated regions {(UTRs).} Muscle and liver had the least
            complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly
            ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a
            few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis
            expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of
            genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most
            expressed genes. {mRNAs} expressed in brain had unusually long
            {3'UTRs,} and mean {3'UTR} length was higher for genes involved in
            development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added
            complexity of {UTR-based} regulation for these genes. Our results
            support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a
            large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
            intracellular proteins.},

    Abstract = {Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various
        human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human
            physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics
            studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across
            tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the
            molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating
            comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a
            tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human
            transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent
            genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues.
            Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets,
            generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and
            postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different

            standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements the data
            requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium.

    Abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues. ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC. Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed, particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries. This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns, their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.},

    Title={Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes},
    Abstract={Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual
        mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may
        have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an
        in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes
        on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding
        a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which
        sequence reads are mapped to exon–exon junctions indicated that 92–94\% of
        human genes undergo alternative splicing, ~86\% with a minor isoform
        frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities
        indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and
        polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between
        individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme
        or ‘switch-like’ regulation of splicing between tissues was associated
        with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with
        generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative
        splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly
        correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these
        processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory
        motifs in both alternative introns and 3′ untranslated regions suggested
        common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both
        splicing and polyadenylation.},

    Abstract={Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct messenger {RNAs} through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced complementary {DNA} from nine tissues from four mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of previously unknown, lineage-specific, and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by {MBNL,} {PTB,} {RBFOX,} {STAR,} and {TIA} family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicate that alternative splicing often alters protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling.},

    Abstract={How species with similar repertoires of protein-coding genes
        differ so markedly at the phenotypic level is poorly understood.
            By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning
            about 350 million years of evolution, we observed significant
            differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate
            lineages, with the highest complexity in primates.
            Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically
            equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related
            to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most
            vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed.
            However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to
            remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators.
            These events likely further contributed to the diversification of
            splicing and other transcriptomic changes that underlie phenotypic
            differences among vertebrate species.},
