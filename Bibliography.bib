    Abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the
        transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs} and proteins.
            Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the
            entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale.
            Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein abundance
            and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than
            5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and protein levels
            correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives
            showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the
            first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and
            proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is
            predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with
            similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional
            properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and
            dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of
            gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a
            greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

    Abstract = {Co-expression networks have proven effective at assigning putative
        functions to genes based on the functional annotation of their
            co-expressed partners, in candidate gene prioritization studies and in
            improving our understanding of regulatory networks. The growing number
            of genome resequencing efforts and genome-wide association studies
            often identify loci containing novel genes and there is a need to infer
            their functions and interaction partners. To facilitate this we have
            expanded {GeneFriends,} an online database that allows users to
            identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This
            expansion entails an {RNA-seq-based} co-expression map that includes
            genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based
            co-expression maps, including over 10 000 non-coding {RNAs.}
        The results users obtain from {GeneFriends} include a co-expression network
            as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the
            co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database
            for different splice variants and {ncRNAs,} such as {microRNAs} and
            {lincRNAs.} Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts
        to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association
            approach. {GeneFriends} is freely available from
            {http://www.GeneFriends.org} and can be used to quickly identify and
        rank candidate targets relevant to the process or disease under study.},

    Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} methods for analyzing {RNA}
            populations {(RNA-Seq)} are gaining rapid application to many
            experimental situations. The steps in an {RNA-Seq} experiment
            require thought and planning, especially because the expense in
            time and materials is currently higher and the protocols are far
            less routine than those used for other high-throughput methods,
            such as microarrays. As always, good experimental design will make
            analysis and interpretation easier. Having a clear biological
            question, an idea about the best way to do the experiment,
            and an understanding of the number of replicates needed will make
            the entire process more satisfying. Whether the goal is capturing
            transcriptome complexity from a tissue or identifying small
            fragments of {RNA} cross-linked to a protein of interest,
            conversion of the {RNA} to {cDNA} followed by direct sequencing
            using the latest methods is a developing practice, with new
            technical modifications and applications appearing every day.
            Even more rapid are the development and improvement of methods
            for analysis of the very large amounts of data that arrive at
            the end of an {RNA-Seq} experiment, making considerations regarding
            reproducibility, validation, visualization, and interpretation
            increasingly important. This introduction is designed to review and
            emphasize a pathway of analysis from experimental design through data
            presentation that is likely to be successful, with the recognition
            that better methods are right around the corner.},

    Abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the
            biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized
            the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level
            through analysis of {RNA} deep sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} data across
            human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that
            roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed,
            contributing to around 75\% of all {mRNAs} by message copy number
            in most tissues. These {mRNAs} encoded proteins that were often
            intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism,
            transcription, {RNA} processing or translation. In contrast,
            genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally
            expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression
            levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
            concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates
            that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better
            with {qRT-PCR} data than estimates which also included 3'
            untranslated regions {(UTRs).} Muscle and liver had the least
            complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly
            ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a
            few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis
            expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of
            genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most
            expressed genes. {mRNAs} expressed in brain had unusually long
            {3'UTRs,} and mean {3'UTR} length was higher for genes involved in
            development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added
            complexity of {UTR-based} regulation for these genes. Our results
            support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a
            large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
            intracellular proteins.},

    Abstract = {Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various
        human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human
        physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics
        studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across
        tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the
        molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating
        comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a
        tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human
        transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent
        genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues.
        Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets,
        generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and
        postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different
        genome-wide analyses support a distribution in which many proteins
        are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted
        manner. Moreover, we discuss the applications of publicly available
        omics data for building genome-scale metabolic models, used for

            the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the
            previous update manuscript in the Database Issue in 2013. PRIDE
            Archive constitutes a complete redevelopment of the original PRIDE,
            comprising a new storage backend, data submission system and web

            standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements the data
            requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium.

        species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms
            due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a
            polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation
            sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues.
            ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far
            exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA
            methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses
            both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show
            enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC.
            Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher
            levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial
            than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed,
        particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi
            syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly
            expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater
            than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find
            novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries.
            This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates
            the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns,

        on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding
        a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which
        sequence reads are mapped to exon–exon junctions indicated that 92–94\% of
        human genes undergo alternative splicing, ~86\% with a minor isoform
        frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities
        indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and
        polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between
        individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme
        or ‘switch-like’ regulation of splicing between tissues was associated
        with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with
        generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative
        splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly
        correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these
        processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory
        motifs in both alternative introns and 3′ untranslated regions suggested
        common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both
        splicing and polyadenylation.},

                 analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently
                 prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the
                 sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten
                 species that represent all major mammalian lineages
                 (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the
                 evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the
                 dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that
                 the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs,
                 lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective
                 pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues
                 and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and
                 monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its
                 formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was
                 strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous
                 potentially selectively driven expression switches, which
                 occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and
                 which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of

            a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of
            previously unknown, lineage-specific, and conserved alternative exons

            By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning
            about 350 million years of evolution, we observed significant
            differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate
            lineages, with the highest complexity in primates.
            Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically
            equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related
            to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most
            vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed.
            However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to
            remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators.
            These events likely further contributed to the diversification of
            splicing and other transcriptomic changes that underlie phenotypic

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A vast amount of DNA variation is being identified by
              increasingly large-scale exome and genome sequencing projects. To
              be useful, variants require accurate functional annotation and a
              wide range of tools are available to this end. McCarthy et al
              recently demonstrated the large differences in prediction of
              loss-of-function (LoF) variation when RefSeq and Ensembl
              transcripts are used for annotation, highlighting the importance
              of the reference transcripts on which variant functional
              annotation is based. RESULTS: We describe a detailed analysis of
              the similarities and differences between the gene and transcript
              annotation in the GENCODE and RefSeq genesets. We demonstrate
              that the GENCODE Comprehensive set is richer in alternative
              splicing, novel CDSs, novel exons and has higher genomic coverage
              than RefSeq, while the GENCODE Basic set is very similar to
              RefSeq. Using RNAseq data we show that exons and introns unique
              to one geneset are expressed at a similar level to those common
              to both. We present evidence that the differences in gene
              annotation lead to large differences in variant annotation where
              GENCODE and RefSeq are used as reference transcripts, although
              this is predominantly confined to non-coding transcripts and UTR
              sequence, with at most ~30\% of LoF variants annotated
              discordantly. We also describe an investigation of dominant
              transcript expression, showing that it both supports the utility
              of the GENCODE Basic set in providing a smaller set of more
              highly expressed transcripts and provides a useful,
              biologically-relevant filter for further reducing the complexity
              of the transcriptome. CONCLUSIONS: The reference transcripts
              selected for variant functional annotation do have a large effect
              on the outcome. The GENCODE Comprehensive transcripts contain
              more exons, have greater genomic coverage and capture many more
              variants than RefSeq in both genome and exome datasets, while the
              GENCODE Basic set shows a higher degree of concordance with
              RefSeq and has fewer unique features. We propose that the GENCODE
              Comprehensive set has great utility for the discovery of new
              variants with functional potential, while the GENCODE Basic set
              is more suitable for applications demanding less complex
              interpretation of functional variants.},

  Abstract = {Sequencing the human genome gave new insights into human biology and disease.
      However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each
          of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of
          each protein. Uhl{\'e}n et al. now present a map of protein expression
          across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA
          level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the
          corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of
          expression patterns across the human body. Resolving the molecular
          details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of
          the human body would greatly increase our knowledge of human biology
          and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based
          on quantitative transcriptomics on a tissue and organ level combined
          with protein profiling using microarray-based immunohistochemistry to
          achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level.
          We provide a global analysis of the secreted and membrane proteins, as
          well as an analysis of the expression profiles for all proteins
          targeted by pharmaceutical drugs and proteins implicated in cancer.
          RATIONALE We have used an integrative omics approach to study the
          spatial human proteome. Samples representing all major tissues and
          organs (n = 44) in the human body have been analyzed based on 24,028
          antibodies corresponding to 16,975 protein-encoding genes,
      complemented with RNA-sequencing data for 32 of the tissues. The antibodies
          have been used to produce more than 13 million tissue-based
          immunohistochemistry images, each annotated by pathologists for all
          sampled tissues. To facilitate integration with other biological
          resources, all data are available for download and cross-referencing.
          RESULTSWe report a genome-wide analysis of the tissue specificity of
          RNA and protein expression covering more than 90\% of the putative
          protein-coding genes, complemented with analyses of various subproteomes,
          such as predicted secreted proteins (n = 3171) and membrane-bound
          proteins (n = 5570). The analysis shows that almost half of the genes
          are expressed in all analyzed tissues, which suggests that the gene
          products are needed in all cells to maintain
          {\textquotedblleft}housekeeping{\textquotedblright} functions such as
      cell growth, energy generation, and basic metabolism. Furthermore, there is
          enrichment in metabolism among these genes, as 60\% of all metabolic
          enzymes are expressed in all analyzed tissues. The largest number of
          tissue-enriched genes is found in the testis, followed by the brain
          and the liver. Analysis of the 618 proteins targeted by clinically
          approved drugs unexpectedly showed that 30\% are expressed in all
          analyzed tissues. An analysis of metabolic activity based on
          genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS) revealed liver as the most
          metabolically active tissue, followed by adipose tissue and skeletal
          muscle.
          CONCLUSIONSA freely available interactive resource is presented as
          part of the Human Protein Atlas portal (www.proteinatlas.org),
          offering the possibility to explore the tissue-elevated proteomes
          in tissues and organs and to analyze tissue profiles for specific
          protein classes. Comprehensive lists of proteins expressed at elevated
          levels in the different tissues have been compiled to provide a spatial
          context with localization of the proteins in the subcompartments of
          each tissue and organ down to the single-cell level.The human
          tissue{\textendash}enriched proteins.All tissue-enriched proteins are
          shown for 13 representative tissues or groups of tissues, stratified
          according to their predicted subcellular localization. Enriched
          proteins are mainly intracellular in testis, mainly membrane bound in
          brain and kidney, and mainly secreted in pancreas and liver.Resolving
          the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues
          and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of
          human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue
          proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves
          quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined
          with tissue microarray{\textendash}based immunohistochemistry, to
          achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell
          level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90\% of the
          putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore
          the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome,
          the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different
          tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive
          Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins,
          as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major
         tissues and organs in the human body.},

    Abstract={Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing
        underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence
            data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to
            investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals
            and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional
            signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures
            are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most
            clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue
            and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high
            interindividual expression variation include disease candidates
            associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is
            the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing
            mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a
            more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its
            stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in
            defining individual phenotypes.},

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is subdivided
                 into different anatomical organs with many shared functions
                 and characteristics, but also distinct differences. We have
                 combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with
                 immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to describe the
                 gene and protein expression patterns that define the human
                 GIT. METHODS: RNA sequencing data derived from stomach,
                 duodenum, jejunum/ileum and colon specimens were compared to
                 gene expression levels in 23 other normal human tissues
                 analysed with the same method. Protein profiling based on
                 immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays was used to
                 sub-localize the corresponding proteins with GIT-specific
                 expression into sub-cellular compartments and cell types.
                 RESULTS: Approximately 75\% of all human protein-coding genes
                 were expressed in at least one of the GIT tissues. Only 51
                 genes showed enriched expression in either one of the GIT
                 tissues and an additional 83 genes were enriched in two or
                 more GIT tissues. The list of GIT-enriched genes with
                 validated protein expression patterns included various
                 well-known but also previously uncharacterised or poorly
                 studied genes. For instance, the colon-enriched expression of
                 NXPE family member 1 (NXPE1) was established, while NLR
                 family, pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6) expression was
                 primarily found in the human small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: We
                 have applied a genome-wide analysis based on transcriptomics
                 and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes that
                 are expressed in a specific manner within the human GIT. These
                 genes and proteins constitute important starting points for an
                 improved understanding of the normal function and the
                 different states of disease associated with the GIT.},

  Abstract    = {Protein noise measurements are increasingly used to elucidate
                 biophysical parameters. Unfortunately noise analyses are often
                 at odds with directly measured parameters. Here we show that
                 these inconsistencies arise from two problematic analytical
                 choices: (i) the assumption that protein translation rate is
                 invariant for different proteins of different abundances,
                 which has inadvertently led to (ii) the assumption that a
                 large constitutive extrinsic noise sets the low noise limit in
                 gene expression. While growing evidence suggests that
                 transcriptional bursting may set the low noise limit,
                 variability in translational bursting has been largely
                 ignored. We show that genome-wide systematic variation in
                 translational efficiency can-and in the case of E. coli
                 does-control the low noise limit in gene expression. Therefore
                 constitutive extrinsic noise is small and only plays a role in
                 the absence of a systematic variation in translational
                 efficiency. These results show the existence of two distinct
                 expression noise patterns: (1) a global noise floor uniformly
                 imposed on all genes by expression bursting; and (2) high
                 noise distributed to only a select group of genes.},

                 equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements
                 of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a
                 draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution
                 Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic
                 profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including
                 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary

                 encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84\% of

  Abstract    = {This letter analyzes two large-scale proteomics studies
                 published in the same issue of Nature. At the time of the
                 release, both studies were portrayed as draft maps of the
                 human proteome and great advances in the field. As with the
                 initial publication of the human genome, these papers have
                 broad appeal and will no doubt lead to a great deal of further
                 analysis by the scientific community. However, we were
                 intrigued by the number of protein-coding genes detected by
                 the two studies, numbers that far exceeded what has been
                 reported for the multinational Human Proteome Project effort.
                 We carried out a simple quality test on the data using the
                 olfactory receptor family. A high-quality proteomics
                 experiment that does not specifically analyze nasal tissues
                 should not expect to detect many peptides for olfactory
                 receptors. Neither of the studies carried out experiments on
                 nasal tissues, yet we found peptide evidence for more than 100
                 olfactory receptors in the two studies. These results suggest
                 that the two studies are substantially overestimating the
                 number of protein coding genes they identify. We conclude that
                 the experimental data from these two studies should be used

    Abstract={The completion of the sequencing of the human genome and the

            among researchers and also accurate integration with genomic data.
            PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) addresses these needs by
            identifying peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS),
        statistically validating those identifications and then mapping
            identified sequences to the genomes of eukaryotic organisms.
            A meaningful comparison of data across different experiments
            generated by different groups using different types of instruments
            is enabled by the implementation of a uniform analytic process.
            This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and
            high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications. The raw

  Abstract    = {Fast-evolving technologies have enabled researchers to easily
                 generate data at genome scale, and using these technologies to
                 compare biological states typically results in a list of
                 candidate genes. Researchers are then faced with the daunting
                 task of prioritizing these candidate genes for follow-up
                 studies. There are hundreds, possibly even thousands, of
                 web-based gene annotation resources available, but it quickly
                 becomes impractical to manually access and review all of these
                 sites for each gene in a candidate gene list. BioGPS
                 (http://biogps.org) was created as a centralized gene portal
                 for aggregating distributed gene annotation resources,
                 emphasizing community extensibility and user customizability.
                 BioGPS serves as a convenient tool for users to access known
                 gene-centric resources, as well as a mechanism to discover new
                 resources that were previously unknown to the user. This
                 article describes updates to BioGPS made after its initial
                 release in 2008. We summarize recent additions of features and
                 data, as well as the robust user activity that underlies this
                 community intelligence application. Finally, we describe
                 MyGene.info (http://mygene.info) and related web services that

  Title       = {{RNA-Seq} gene profiling--a systematic empirical comparison},
  Author      = {Fonseca, Nuno A and Marioni, John and Brazma, Alvis},
  Abstract    = {Accurately quantifying gene expression levels is a key goal of
                 experiments using RNA-sequencing to assay the transcriptome.
                 This typically requires aligning the short reads generated to
                 the genome or transcriptome before quantifying expression of
                 pre-defined sets of genes. Differences in the
                 alignment/quantification tools can have a major effect upon
                 the expression levels found with important consequences for
                 biological interpretation. Here we address two main issues: do
                 different analysis pipelines affect the gene expression levels
                 inferred from RNA-seq data? And, how close are the expression
                 levels inferred to the ``true'' expression levels? We evaluate
                 fifty gene profiling pipelines in experimental and simulated
                 data sets with different characteristics (e.g, read length and
                 sequencing depth). In the absence of knowledge of the 'ground
                 truth' in real RNAseq data sets, we used simulated data to
                 assess the differences between the ``true'' expression and
                 those reconstructed by the analysis pipelines. Even though
                 this approach does not take into account all known biases
                 present in RNAseq data, it still allows to estimate the
                 accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by different
                 analysis pipelines. The results show that i) overall there is
                 a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by
                 the best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the
                 error in the estimated gene expression values can vary
                 considerably across genes; and iii) a small set of genes have
                 expression estimates with consistently high error (across data
                 sets and methods). Finally, although the mapping software is
                 important, the quantification method makes a greater
                 difference to the results.},

  Title       = {{HeLa} nucleic acid contamination in the cancer genome atlas
                 leads to the misidentification of human papillomavirus 18},
  Author      = {Cantalupo, Paul G and Katz, Joshua P and Pipas, James M},
  Abstract    = { We searched The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
                 database for viruses by comparing non-human reads present in
                 transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole-exome sequencing
                 (WXS) data to viral sequence databases. Human papillomavirus
                 18 (HPV18) is an etiologic agent of cervical cancer, and as
                 expected, we found robust expression of HPV18 genes in
                 cervical cancer samples. In agreement with previous studies,
                 we also found HPV18 transcripts in non-cervical cancer
                 samples, including those from the colon, rectum, and normal
                 kidney. However, in each of these cases, HPV18 gene expression
                 was low, and single-nucleotide variants and positions of
                 genomic alignments matched the integrated portion of HPV18
                 present in HeLa cells. Chimeric reads that match a known
                 virus-cell junction of HPV18 integrated in HeLa cells were
                 also present in some samples. We hypothesize that HPV18
                 sequences in these non-cervical samples are due to nucleic
                 acid contamination from HeLa cells. This finding highlights
                 the problems that contamination presents in computational
                 virus detection pipelines. IMPORTANCE: Viruses associated with
                 cancer can be detected by searching tumor sequence databases.
                 Several studies involving searches of the TCGA database have
                 reported the presence of HPV18, a known cause of cervical
                 cancer, in a small number of additional cancers, including
                 those of the rectum, kidney, and colon. We have determined
                 that the sequences related to HPV18 in non-cervical samples
                 are due to nucleic acid contamination from HeLa cells. To our
                 knowledge, this is the first report of the misidentification
                 of viruses in next-generation sequencing data of tumors due to
                 contamination with a cancer cell line. These results raise
                 awareness of the difficulty of accurately identifying viruses
                 in human sequence databases.},

                 in the statistical strategy adopted. However, as data continue

                 prognostic gene signatures},
  Author      = {Zwiener, Isabella and Frisch, Barbara and Binder, Harald},
  Abstract    = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for
                 building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short
                 list of important genes that can predict patient outcome.
                 Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there
                 is little advice available for building multivariable risk
                 prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider
                 penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and
                 componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all
                 measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models
                 for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they
                 might be affected by the typical skewness,
                 mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq
                 covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of
                 the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential
                 selection of covariates with large variances, which is
                 problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq
                 data. In a simulation study, we compare different
                 transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving
                 detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider
                 standardization, the log transformation, a
                 variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox
                 transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition,
                 the prediction performance for real data from patients with
                 kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We
                 show that signature size, identification performance, and
                 prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a
                 suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform
                 well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex
                 variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results
                 illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations
                 of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when
                 building risk prediction models by penalized regression
                 techniques.},

                 cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout
                 mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug
                 treatment. We stored these associations in a relational
                 database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins,
                 their attributes and the original resources. The freely
                 available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user
                 interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying,
                 browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To
                 demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and
                 visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity
                 networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many
                 unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such
                 as the association between kinase perturbations and disease
                 signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning
                 methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous
                 ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for
                 knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane
                 proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome
                 is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and
                 proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover
                 novel relationships between biological entities, as well as

  Abstract    = {QuaCRS (Quality Control for RNA-Seq) is an integrated,
                 simplified quality control (QC) system for RNA-seq data that
                 allows easy execution of several open-source QC tools,
                 aggregation of their output, and the ability to quickly
                 identify quality issues by performing meta-analyses on QC
                 metrics across large numbers of samples in different studies.
                 It comprises two main sections. First is the QC Pack wrapper,
                 which executes three QC tools: FastQC, RNA-SeQC, and selected
                 functions from RSeQC. Combining these three tools into one
                 wrapper provides increased ease of use and provides a much
                 more complete view of sample data quality than any individual
                 tool. Second is the QC database, which displays the resulting
                 metrics in a user-friendly web interface. It was designed to
                 allow users with less computational experience to easily
                 generate and view QC information for their data, to
                 investigate individual samples and aggregate reports of sample
                 groups, and to sort and search samples based on quality. The
                 structure of the QuaCRS database is designed to enable
                 expansion with additional tools and metrics in the future. The
                 source code for not-for-profit use and a fully functional
                 sample user interface with mock data are available at

                 estimates},
  Author      = {Williams, Claire R and Baccarella, Alyssa and Parrish, Jay Z
                 and Kim, Charles C},
  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has
                 become the preferred technique for studying gene expression
                 differences between biological samples and for discovering
                 novel isoforms, though the techniques to analyze the resulting
                 data are still immature. One pre-processing step that is
                 widely but heterogeneously applied is trimming, in which low
                 quality bases, identified by the probability that they are
                 called incorrectly, are removed. However, the impact of
                 trimming on subsequent alignment to a genome could influence
                 downstream analyses including gene expression estimation; we
                 hypothesized that this might occur in an inconsistent manner
                 across different genes, resulting in differential bias.
                 RESULTS: To assess the effects of trimming on gene expression,
                 we generated RNA-Seq data sets from four samples of larval
                 Drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons, and used three
                 trimming algorithms--SolexaQA, Trimmomatic, and ConDeTri-to
                 perform quality-based trimming across a wide range of
                 stringencies. After aligning the reads to the D. melanogaster
                 genome with TopHat2, we used Cuffdiff2 to compare the
                 original, untrimmed gene expression estimates to those
                 following trimming. With the most aggressive trimming
                 parameters, over ten percent of genes had significant changes
                 in their estimated expression levels. This trend was seen with
                 two additional RNA-Seq data sets and with alternative
                 differential expression analysis pipelines. We found that the
                 majority of the expression changes could be mitigated by
                 imposing a minimum length filter following trimming,
                 suggesting that the differential gene expression was primarily
                 being driven by spurious mapping of short reads. Slight
                 differences with the untrimmed data set remained after length
                 filtering, which were associated with genes with low exon
                 numbers and high GC content. Finally, an analysis of paired
                 RNA-seq/microarray data sets suggests that no or modest
                 trimming results in the most biologically accurate gene
                 expression estimates. CONCLUSIONS: We find that aggressive
                 quality-based trimming has a large impact on the apparent
                 makeup of RNA-Seq-based gene expression estimates, and that
                 short reads can have a particularly strong impact. We conclude
                 that implementation of trimming in RNA-Seq analysis workflows
                 warrants caution, and if used, should be used in conjunction
                 with a minimum read length filter to minimize the introduction
                 of unpredictable changes in expression estimates.},

  Abstract = {Three principal approaches have been proposed for inferring the
              set of transcripts expressed in RNA samples using RNA-seq. The
              simplest approach uses curated annotations, which assumes the
              transcripts in a sample are a subset of the transcripts listed in
              a curated database. A more ambitious method involves aligning
              reads to a reference genome and using the alignments to infer the
              transcript structures, possibly with the aid of a curated
              transcript database. The most challenging approach is to assemble
              reads into putative transcripts de novo without the aid of
              reference data. We have systematically assessed the properties of
              these three approaches through a simulation study. We have found
              that the sensitivity of computational transcript set estimation
              is severely limited. Computational approaches (both genome-guided
              and de novo assembly) produce a large number of artefacts, which
              are assigned large expression estimates and absorb a substantial
              proportion of the signal when performing expression analysis. The
              approach using curated annotations shows good expression
              correlation even when the annotations are incomplete.
              Furthermore, any incorrect transcripts present in a curated set
              do not absorb much signal, so it is preferable to have a curation
              set with high sensitivity than high precision. Software to

                 RNA-seq compared to microarray data. Analysis of this
                 variability revealed a lack of reads for short and low
                 abundant genes; lncRNAs, being shorter and less abundant RNAs,
                 were found especially susceptible to this issue. A major
                 difference between the two platforms was uncovered by analysis
                 of alternatively spliced genes. Investigation of differential
                 exon abundance showed insufficient reads for many exons and
                 exon junctions in RNA-seq while the detection on the array
                 platform was more stable. Nevertheless, we identified 207
                 genes which undergo alternative splicing and were consistently
                 detected by both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact
                 that the results of gene expression analysis were highly
                 consistent between Human Transcriptome Arrays and RNA-seq
                 platforms, the analysis of alternative splicing produced
                 discordant results. We concluded that modern microarrays can
                 still outperform sequencing for standard analysis of gene
                 expression in terms of reproducibility and cost.},

  Abstract    = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003,
                 extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing
                 technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase
                 and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced
                 genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has
                 been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even
                 greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of
                 bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a
                 wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly
                 complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to
                 sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential
                 for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other
                 strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety
                 of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an
                 enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants

  Abstract    = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq is replacing microarrays as the primary
                 tool for gene expression studies. Many RNA-seq studies have
                 used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low
                 statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.
                 RESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more
                 biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing
                 power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the
                 human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M
                 reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes,
                 whereas adding biological replicates improves power
                 significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose
                 a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of
                 large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that
                 sequencing less reads and performing more biological
                 replication is an effective strategy to increase power and
                 accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq

  Abstract    = {Recent advances in sequencing technology have helped unveil
                 the unexpected complexity and diversity of small RNAs. A
                 critical step in small RNA library preparation for sequencing
                 is the ligation of adapter sequences to both the 5' and 3'
                 ends of small RNAs. Studies have shown that adapter ligation
                 introduces a significant but widely unappreciated bias in the
                 results of high-throughput small RNA sequencing. We show that
                 due to this bias the two widely used Illumina library
                 preparation protocols produce strikingly different microRNA
                 (miRNA) expression profiles in the same batch of cells. There
                 are 102 highly expressed miRNAs that are >5-fold
                 differentially detected and some miRNAs, such as miR-24-3p,
                 are over 30-fold differentially detected. While some level of
                 bias in library preparation is not surprising, the apparent
                 massive differential bias between these two widely used
                 adapter sets is not well appreciated. In an attempt to
                 mitigate this bias, the new Bioo Scientific NEXTflex V2
                 protocol utilizes a pool of adapters with random nucleotides
                 at the ligation boundary. We show that this protocol is able
                 to detect robustly several miRNAs that evade capture by the

  Author    = {Zhuang, Fanglei and Fuchs, Ryan T and Robb, G Brett},
  Abstract  = {Eukaryotic regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) play significant roles
               in many fundamental cellular processes. As such, they have
               emerged as useful biomarkers for diseases and cell
               differentiation states. sRNA-based biomarkers outperform
               traditional messenger RNA-based biomarkers by testing fewer
               targets with greater accuracy and providing earlier detection
               for disease states. Therefore, expression profiling of sRNAs is
               fundamentally important to further advance the understanding of
               biological processes, as well as diagnosis and treatment of
               diseases. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is a powerful

  Abstract    = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling
                 discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
                 Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
                 pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
                 human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
                 fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
                 compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
                 variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
                 billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment
                 at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat
                 surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic
                 sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator
                 deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to
                 generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of
                 this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X
                 chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the
                 genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We
                 build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth
                 of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million

              active transcriptional processes are changing -- information that
              is useful for understanding the status and function of a sample.
              Nanopore-based sequencing technology is capable of electronically
              analysing a sample9s DNA directly, and in real-time. In this
              manuscript we demonstrate the ability of an array of nanopores to
              sequence RNA directly, and we apply it to a range of biological
              situations. Nanopore technology is the only available sequencing
              technology which can sequence RNA directly, rather than depending
              on reverse transcription and PCR. There are several potential
              advantages of this approach over other RNA-seq strategies,
              including the absence of amplification and reverse transcription
              biases, the ability to detect nucleotide analogues and the
              ability to generate full-length, strand-specific RNA sequences.
              This will improve the ease and speed of RNA analysis, while

                 Several studies have highlighted the importance of
                 coral-associated bacteria and their fundamental roles in
                 fitness and survival of the host animal. The scleractinian
                 coral Porites lutea is one of the dominant reef-builders in
                 the Indo-West Pacific. Currently, very little is known about
                 the composition and structure of bacterial communities across
                 P. lutea reefs. The purpose of this study is twofold: to
                 demonstrate the advantages of using PacBio circular consensus
                 sequencing technology in microbial community studies and to
                 investigate the diversity and structure of P. lutea-associated

                 study of marine environmental samples that utilises the PacBio
                 sequencing system to capture full-length 16S rRNA sequences.
                 We observed geographically distinct coral-associated microbial
                 profiles between samples from the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman
                 Sea. Despite the geographical and environmental impacts on the
                 coral-host interactions, we identified a conserved community
                 of bacteria that were present consistently across diverse reef
                 habitats. Finally, we demonstrated the superior performance of
                 full-length 16S rRNA sequences in resolving taxonomic

                 sequencing platforms are often preceded by a pre-processing
                 step that removes uncalled and wrongly called bases. Standard
                 approaches rely on their associated base quality scores to
                 retain the read or a portion of it when the score is above a
                 predefined threshold. It is difficult to differentiate
                 sequencing error from biological variation without a reference
                 using quality scores. The effects of quality score based
                 trimming have not been systematically studied in de novo
                 transcriptome assembly. Using RNA-Seq data produced from
                 Illumina, we teased out the effects of quality score based
                 filtering or trimming on de novo transcriptome reconstruction.
                 We showed that assemblies produced from reads subjected to

                 missing transfrags when compared to those from untrimmed
                 reads. Our data supports the fact that de novo assembling of
                 untrimmed data is challenging for de Bruijn graph assemblers.
                 However, our results indicates that comparing the assemblies
                 from untrimmed and trimmed read subsets can suggest
                 appropriate filtering parameters and enable selection of the

  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The generation and analysis of high-throughput
                 sequencing data are becoming a major component of many studies
                 in molecular biology and medical research. Illumina's Genome
                 Analyzer (GA) and HiSeq instruments are currently the most
                 widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively
                 evaluate properties of genomic HiSeq and GAIIx data derived
                 from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95
                 to 150 bases. RESULTS: We provide quantifications and evidence
                 for GC bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of
                 quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By
                 combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates
                 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5\% of alignable bases.
                 While overall error rates are low in HiSeq data we observed
                 regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error
                 positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution errors.
                 Analyzing the forward and reverse strands separately revealed
                 error rates of up to 18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred
                 at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in
                 homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and
                 GC content was found depending on the GC content range.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The errors and biases we report have implications
                 for the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing
                 data. GAIIx and HiSeq data sets show slightly different error
                 profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize
                 downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous
                 recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion
                 to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance
                 polymorphisms.},

  Author      = {Wajid, Bilal and Serpedin, Erchin},
  Abstract    = {In the realm of bioinformatics and computational biology, the
                 most rudimentary data upon which all the analysis is built is
                 the sequence data of genes, proteins and RNA. The sequence
                 data of the entire genome is the solution to the genome
                 assembly problem. The scope of this contribution is to provide
                 an overview on the art of problem-solving applied within the
                 domain of genome assembly in the next-generation sequencing
                 (NGS) platforms. This article discusses the major genome
                 assemblers that were proposed in the literature during the
                 past decade by outlining their basic working principles. It is
                 intended to act as a qualitative, not a quantitative, tutorial
                 to all working on genome assemblers pertaining to the next
                 generation of sequencers. We discuss the theoretical aspects
                 of various genome assemblers, identifying their working
                 schemes. We also discuss briefly the direction in which the
                 area is headed towards along with discussing core issues on
                 software simplicity.},

  Abstract    = {HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of
                 transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads
                 from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme
                 based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the
                 Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes
                 for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each
                 alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid
                 extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for
                 the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each
                 representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and
                 simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system
                 currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any
                 other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
                 requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes
                 of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

  Abstract    = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data
                 is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
                 non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
                 lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                 technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
                 high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
                 limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large
                 (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
                 developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                 (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
                 alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
                 search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed
                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour
                 on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving
                 alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased
                 de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
                 non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and
                 is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using
                 Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
                 reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
                 intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,
                 corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
                 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a
                 standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software

                 been conducted, the question remains how individual methods
                 perform at accurately quantifying gene expression levels from
                 RNA-sequencing reads. We performed an independent benchmarking
                 study using RNA-sequencing data from the well established
                 MAQCA and MAQCB reference samples. RNA-sequencing reads were
                 processed using five workflows (Tophat-HTSeq,
                 Tophat-Cufflinks, STAR-HTSeq, Kallisto and Salmon) and
                 resulting gene expression measurements were compared to
                 expression data generated by wet-lab validated qPCR assays for
                 all protein coding genes. All methods showed high gene
                 expression correlations with qPCR data. When comparing gene
                 expression fold changes between MAQCA and MAQCB samples, about
                 85\% of the genes showed consistent results between
                 RNA-sequencing and qPCR data. Of note, each method revealed a
                 small but specific gene set with inconsistent expression
                 measurements. A significant proportion of these
                 method-specific inconsistent genes were reproducibly
                 identified in independent datasets. These genes were typically
                 smaller, had fewer exons, and were lower expressed compared to
                 genes with consistent expression measurements. We propose that
                 careful validation is warranted when evaluating RNA-seq based
                 expression profiles for this specific gene set.},

                 to human disease},
  Author      = {Robert, Christelle and Watson, Mick},
  Abstract    = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has emerged as the standard for measuring
                 gene expression and is an important technique often used in
                 studies of human disease. Gene expression quantification
                 involves comparison of the sequenced reads to a known genomic
                 or transcriptomic reference. The accuracy of that
                 quantification relies on there being enough unique information
                 in the reads to enable bioinformatics tools to accurately
                 assign the reads to the correct gene. RESULTS: We apply 12
                 common methods to estimate gene expression from RNA-Seq data
                 and show that there are hundreds of genes whose expression is
                 underestimated by one or more of those methods. Many of these
                 genes have been implicated in human disease, and we describe
                 their roles. We go on to propose a two-stage analysis of
                 RNA-Seq data in which multi-mapped or ambiguous reads can
                 instead be uniquely assigned to groups of genes. We apply this
                 method to a recently published mouse cancer study, and
                 demonstrate that we can extract relevant biological signal
                 from data that would otherwise have been discarded.
                 CONCLUSIONS: For hundreds of genes in the human genome,
                 RNA-Seq is unable to measure expression accurately. These
                 genes are enriched for gene families, and many of them have
                 been implicated in human disease. We show that it is possible
                 to use data that may otherwise have been discarded to measure
                 group-level expression, and that such data contains
                 biologically relevant information.},

              significantly higher level than others, that in human tissues the
              major transcripts contribute almost 85 percent to the total mRNA
              from protein coding loci, and that often the same major
              transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a high degree
              of overlap between the set of major transcripts and a recently
              published set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are
              predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data. Thus, we
              hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may play a
              functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main
              contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a
              non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the
              major transcript does not code a protein. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding
              loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all the
              transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are
              equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This
              observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in
              proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the
              detected changes in variation studies.},

                 sequencing using next-generation sequencing platforms is
                 rapidly becoming accepted as a tool for measuring gene
                 expression for both research and clinical use. Fresh frozen
                 (FF) tissue specimens of GBM are difficult to obtain since
                 tumor tissue obtained at surgery is often scarce and necrotic
                 and diagnosis is prioritized over freezing. After diagnosis,
                 leftover tissue is usually stored as formalin-fixed
                 paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. However, RNA from FFPE
                 tissues is usually degraded, which could hamper gene
                 expression analysis. We compared RNA-Seq data obtained from
                 matched pairs of FF and FFPE GBM specimens. Only three FFPE
                 out of eleven FFPE-FF matched samples yielded informative
                 results. Several quality-control measurements showed that RNA
                 from FFPE samples was highly degraded but maintained
                 transcriptomic similarities to RNA from FF samples. Certain
                 issues regarding mutation analysis and subtype prediction were
                 detected. Nevertheless, our results suggest that RNA-Seq of
                 FFPE GBM specimens provides reliable gene expression data that
                 can be used in molecular studies of GBM if the RNA is

                 prognostic gene signatures},
  Author      = {Zwiener, Isabella and Frisch, Barbara and Binder, Harald},
  Abstract    = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for
                 building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short
                 list of important genes that can predict patient outcome.
                 Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there
                 is little advice available for building multivariable risk
                 prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider
                 penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and
                 componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all
                 measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models
                 for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they
                 might be affected by the typical skewness,
                 mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq
                 covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of
                 the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential
                 selection of covariates with large variances, which is
                 problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq
                 data. In a simulation study, we compare different
                 transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving
                 detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider
                 standardization, the log transformation, a
                 variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox
                 transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition,
                 the prediction performance for real data from patients with
                 kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We
                 show that signature size, identification performance, and
                 prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a
                 suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform
                 well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex
                 variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results
                 illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations
                 of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when
                 building risk prediction models by penalized regression

                 sets produced by the sequencers create a need for development
                 of statistical and computational methods that can tackle the
                 analysis and management of data. The data normalization is one
                 of the most crucial steps of data processing and this process

  Abstract    = {The sequencing of the full transcriptome (RNA-seq) has become
                 the preferred choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene
                 expression. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain in
                 RNA-seq data analysis. One often-overlooked aspect is
                 normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of factors or
                 'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data,
                 commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for
                 sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly
                 problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety
                 of biological factors in addition to the one of interest.
                 Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that
                 batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that
                 the choice of normalization method affects the power and
                 reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global
                 normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the
                 data, more recently developed RNA-seq normalization can. We
                 focus on one particular method, RUVSeq and show that it is
                 able to increase power and biological insight of the results.
                 Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of
                 RUVSeq normalization that is applicable to a broad range of

  Abstract    = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale
                 is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular
                 biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted
                 this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of
                 variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a
                 decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The
                 recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has
                 generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced
                 variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show
                 that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring
                 variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays.
                 In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content)
                 has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression
                 measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false
                 positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly
                 observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data
                 normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology
                 that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our
                 resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm
                 combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic
                 bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content
                 and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

  Abstract    = {Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven
                 essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels.
                 Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly
                 account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library
                 preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects.
                 We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control
                 Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the
                 possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show
                 that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in
                 standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization
                 procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
                 unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical
                 effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of
                 control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g.,
                 replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate
                 estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
                 expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.
                 In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large
                 collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories,
                 technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},
