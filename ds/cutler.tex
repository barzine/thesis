\chapter{Cutler data}
\label{ch:cutlerData}



This data was generated prior to the \dataset{Pandey} and the \dataset{Kuster}
data as it was released in 2011 through PeptideAtlas\footnote{%
\href{http://www.peptideatlas.org/}{www.peptideatlas.org/}}
\citep{PeptideAtlas}.

It was created by Paul Cutler at Roche Pharmaceuticals.
It comprises 10 different tissues (1,618 \gls{CID} Thermo Scientific raw files).

While this data was never published on its own, it has been used in different
other studies. Indeed, the \dataset{Cutler} data is one the datasets that
\cite{KusterData} have used in their original study to create ProteomicsDB.

The raw files were accessed and downloaded from \Proteomicsdb{PRDB000012}.
