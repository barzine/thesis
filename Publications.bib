    Abstract ={Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) provides information
        about gene and protein expression in animal and plant samples of
        different cell types, organism parts, developmental stages, diseases
        and other conditions. It consists of selected microarray and
        RNA-sequencing studies from ArrayExpress, which have been manually
        curated, annotated with ontology terms, checked for high quality and
        processed using standardised analysis methods. Since the last update,
        Atlas has grown seven-fold (1572 studies as of August 2015), and
        incorporates baseline expression profiles of tissues from Human Protein
        Atlas, GTEx and FANTOM5, and of cancer cell lines from ENCODE, CCLE and
        Genentech projects. Plant studies constitute a quarter of Atlas data.
        For genes of interest, the user can view baseline expression in tissues,
        and differential expression for biologically meaningful pairwise
        comparisons—estimated using consistent methodology across all of Atlas.
        Our first proteomics study in human tissues is now displayed alongside
        transcriptomics data in the same tissues. Novel analyses and
        visualisations include: ‘enrichment’ in each differential comparison of
        GO terms, Reactome, Plant Reactome pathways and InterPro domains;
        hierarchical clustering (by baseline expression) of most variable genes
        and experimental conditions; and, for a given gene-condition,
         distribution of baseline expression across biological replicates.},

    Title = {Improving GENCODE reference gene annotation using a high-stringency
        proteogenomics workflow},
    Abstract={Complete annotation of the human genome is indispensable for
        medical research. The GENCODE consortium strives to provide this,
        augmenting computational and experimental evidence with manual annotation.
        The rapidly developing field of proteogenomics provides evidence for the
        translation of genes into proteins and can be used to discover and refine
        gene models. However, for both the proteomics and annotation groups,
        there is a lack of guidelines for integrating this data. Here we report
        a stringent workflow for the interpretation of proteogenomic data that
        could be used by the annotation community to interpret novel proteogenomic
        evidence. Based on reprocessing of three large-scale publicly available
        human data sets, we show that a conservative approach, using stringent
        filtering is required to generate valid identifications. Evidence has
        been found supporting 16 novel protein-coding genes being added to GENCODE.
        Despite this many peptide identifications in pseudogenes cannot be
        annotated due to the absence of orthogonal supporting evidence.},
