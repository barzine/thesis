    Abstract ={Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) provides information
        about gene and protein expression in animal and plant samples of
        different cell types, organism parts, developmental stages, diseases
        and other conditions. It consists of selected microarray and
        RNA-sequencing studies from ArrayExpress, which have been manually
        curated, annotated with ontology terms, checked for high quality and
        processed using standardised analysis methods. Since the last update,
        Atlas has grown seven-fold (1572 studies as of August 2015), and
        incorporates baseline expression profiles of tissues from Human Protein
        Atlas, GTEx and FANTOM5, and of cancer cell lines from ENCODE, CCLE and
        Genentech projects. Plant studies constitute a quarter of Atlas data.
        For genes of interest, the user can view baseline expression in tissues,
        and differential expression for biologically meaningful pairwise
        comparisons—estimated using consistent methodology across all of Atlas.
        Our first proteomics study in human tissues is now displayed alongside
        transcriptomics data in the same tissues. Novel analyses and
        visualisations include: ‘enrichment’ in each differential comparison of
        GO terms, Reactome, Plant Reactome pathways and InterPro domains;
        hierarchical clustering (by baseline expression) of most variable genes
        and experimental conditions; and, for a given gene-condition,
         distribution of baseline expression across biological replicates.},

    Title = {Improving GENCODE reference gene annotation using a high-stringency
        proteogenomics workflow},
    Abstract={Complete annotation of the human genome is indispensable for
        medical research. The GENCODE consortium strives to provide this,
        augmenting computational and experimental evidence with manual annotation.
        The rapidly developing field of proteogenomics provides evidence for the
        translation of genes into proteins and can be used to discover and refine
        gene models. However, for both the proteomics and annotation groups,
        there is a lack of guidelines for integrating this data. Here we report
        a stringent workflow for the interpretation of proteogenomic data that
        could be used by the annotation community to interpret novel proteogenomic
        evidence. Based on reprocessing of three large-scale publicly available
        human data sets, we show that a conservative approach, using stringent
        filtering is required to generate valid identifications. Evidence has
        been found supporting 16 novel protein-coding genes being added to GENCODE.
        Despite this many peptide identifications in pseudogenes cannot be
        annotated due to the absence of orthogonal supporting evidence.},

              PRIDE database, we assembled a proteomics resource for 191 cancer
              cell lines and 246 clinical tumour samples, across 13 cancer
              lineages. We found that baseline protein abundance in cell lines
              was generally representative of tumours. However, when
              considering differences in protein expression between tumour
              subtypes, as exemplified in the breast lineage, many of these
              changes were no longer recapitulated in the cell line models.
              Integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data suggested that
              the level of transcriptional control in cell lines changed
              significantly depending on their lineage. Additionally, in
              agreement with previous studies, variation in mRNA levels was
              often a poor predictor of changes in protein abundance. To our
              knowledge, this work constitutes the first meta-analysis study
              including cancer-related proteomics datasets. We anticipate this
              aggregated dataset will be of significant aid to future studies
              requiring a reference to baseline protein expression in cancer. *

                for estimating protein abundance in human samples typically assay
                a subset of less than 60\% of the ~20,000 genes.
                Computational methods for imputing the missing values
                using RNA expression data exist, but usually they allow only
                for imputations for proteins measured
                in at least some of the samples.
                Computational methods for estimating abundance comprehensively
                across the genome level are still missing.
                Results: We propose a novel method based on deep learning
                to extrapolate the observed protein expression values
                to all proteins using functional annotations and RNA measurements.
                We tested our method on four datasets, including human cell lines,
                and human and mouse tissues. Our method predicts
                the protein expression values with average R2 scores
                between 0.46 and 0.54, which is significantly better than
                predictions based on correlations using the RNA data alone.
                Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived models
                can be “transferred” across experiments and species.
                For instance, the model derived from human tissues gave
                R2=0.49 when applied to mouse tissue data.
                We conclude that computationally estimating protein abundances
                can be feasible.",
