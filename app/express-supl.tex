    different distribution, have equal or very similar descriptive statistic
    indicators. Their means and variances (for both $x$ and $y$ variables),

\section{Correlation}\label{sec:CorrMore}

While $1$ and $-1$ mean a perfect correlation (either positive or negative),
a value equals to $0$ expresses that the two variables are independent.
A value within $\mathopen]-1,0\mathclose[$
or $\mathopen]0,1\mathclose[$ needs more interpretation. In biology, if the
coefficient is within $[-0.5,0.5]$, the variables are often considered as
independent.

\subsection{Spearman correlation}\label{subsec:SpearmanCor}
The Spearman correlation coefficient (usually noted as $\rho$)
is more robust than the Pearson correlation.
However, it only assesses the monotonic dependence between two variables.
The Spearman correlation is equal to the Pearson correlation of the value
\emph{ranks} between two variables.

\subsection{Pearson correlation}\label{subsec:PearsonCor}
The Pearson correlation coefficient (usually noted as $r$) assesses the linear
dependence between two variables. It is invariant to systematic addition of a
constant or to simple scaling factors between the two variables.
